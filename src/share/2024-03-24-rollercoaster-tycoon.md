      RollerCoaster Tycoon didn’t just give millions of fans an infinite toolbox of fun to build the theme parks of their candified dreams (more on this later), but helped to demystify the whole adjacent theme park industry, and make it less male dominated.

I have spent probably *too* many hours playing this game. I enjoyed it so much I recall it getting me into trouble with my parents when I snuck onto the family computer and turned off a different game my dad was playing just so I could be a tycoon!

I had no idea of its wider impact.  It’s inspired people to get into rollercoaster design as a profession and diversified the industry a bit in the process.

I wonder if my [other favourite game of the 90s](/2018/02/04/theme-hospital-gender-equality/) had a similar impact.
