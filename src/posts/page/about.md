      summary:
        organisation: | 
          The Office for Digital Identities and Attributes (OfDIA) is part of the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. 
        
          We develop quality standards for digital verification services and oversee a system of independent assurance, underpinned by legislation. Our work enables people to prove things about themselves in a trustworthy way, digitally, and across the economy, through a range of public and private sector services.
        role: |
          As the Assistant Director for Market Oversight and Integrity, I lead policy and delivery that supports the development of the digital verification services market in the UK. 
          
          I lead the development and maintenance of a UKAS-recognised conformity assessment scheme, aligned to ISO/IEC 17065:2012, that underpins the assurance processes that build trust in digital verification service providers operating in the UK.
          
          I am also the service owner for a [GOV.UK register of digital identity and attribute services](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-registered-digital-identity-and-attribute-services); a statutory register of digital verification services that have been independently assessed as meeting UK government rules. As part of this, I lead a digital delivery team and associated operational teams responsible for building, running and maintaining the integrity of this statutory register.

Hello. 

I'm John Peart. 

I'm originally from Devon, but grew up in North Lincolnshire and Somerset. I live in London now, having originally moved here for university.

I do “policy” in the UK Civil Service. That's a fancy way of saying that I design, develop and deliver programmes of work to meet the objectives of the incumbent government. 

I specialise in digital policy. I'm deeply fascinated by the social consequences of technology. I've also spent a long time working in equalities policy.

I currently work for the [Office for Digital Identities and Attributes](//www.gov.uk/ofdia), a part of the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. We're making it possible to trust digital verification services, so you can use them across the UK economy.
