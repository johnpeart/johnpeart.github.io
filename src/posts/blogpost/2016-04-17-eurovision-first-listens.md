eurovision-entries:
- country: "Finland"
  song: "Sing It Away"
  artist: "Sandhja"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    This is going to be a great opening number that'll pump some energy into the stadium. It's a safe, strong pop affair; and I like it!

- country: "Greece"
  song: "Utopian Land"
  artist: "Argo"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Greece, we need to have words. What happened? Did you go in too heavy on the ouzo when you picked this? *Nil points*.

- country: "Moldova"
  song: "Falling Stars"
  artist: "Lidia Isac"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    This feels like a dated STEPS number. Which should be fun - because we can all do some line dancing in the arena.

- country: "Hungary"
  song: "Pioneer"
  artist: "Freddie"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    There's so much gravel in this guy's throat, I want to give him a throat lozenge. It's a strong vocal for a strong song.

- country: "Croatia"
  song: "Lighthouse"
  artist: "Nina Kraljić"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    This could have been a superb ballad; the instrumentation is intriguing, and there's a key change. But you can't excuse the weak vocals.

- country: "Netherlands"
  song: "Slow Down"
  artist: "Douwe Bob"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    This is like a Beatles-country revival. I'd be happy for this to “speed up brother", just so it was over. Not a fan.

- country: "Armenia"
  song: "LoveWave"
  artist: "Iveta Mukuchyan"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    I've no idea what's going on with the [faux-phone call](https://youtu.be/YQHsXMglC9A?t=33), but its [not the first act](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRAjf9rFA58) to badly [copy a best-selling artist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAkUtig5iG4).

- country: "San Marino"
  song: "I Didn't Know"
  artist: "Serhat"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    San Marino has run out of talent. It was inevitable with a population of 32,000.

    Let's hope this Shaft rip off falls at the first hurdle.

- country: "Russia"
  song: "You Are The Only One"
  artist: "Sergey Lazarev"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    A decent key change, and some false endings make this a pretty full on dance number. A fairly weak male vocal though.

- country: "Czech Republic"
  song: "I Stand"
  artist: "Gabriela Gunčíkov"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    There's clearly a competent singer here, but the song is just uninspiring ballad that never quite pulls your heartstrings.

- country: "Cyprus"
  song: "Alter Ego"
  artist: "Minus One"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    After 2015's Cypriot snooze fest, this is pretty refreshing and fun! I'm not cool enough to have an opinion about this energised rock song.

- country: "Austria"
  song: "Loin d'ici"
  artist: "ZOË"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Austria must've just gotten last year's bill. That's the only reason I can think of for a song with no discernible hook and a 90s vibe.

- country: "Estonia"
  song: "Play"
  artist: "Jüri Pootsmann"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Did Estonia kidnap Jamie Cullum?

    This pop-jazz fusion is pretty interesting but I'm not sure it's strong enough to place well though.

- country: "Azerbaijan"
  song: "Miracle"
  artist: "Samra"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    This reminds me of Arianna Grande. Anthemic, good hook, and good contrast between verse and chorus. This would be at home in the UK Top 40.

- country: "Montenegro"
  song: "The Real Thing"
  artist: "Highway"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Whilst the instrumentation is solid, the lead vocals sound like drunk dads doing karaoke at a wedding. They just drone on, and on, and on...

- country: "Iceland"
  song: "Hear Them Calling"
  artist: "Greta Salóme"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Everything's so nicey-nicey, boring-snoring, and then… *boom* the crazy is let loose. Well played Iceland. Well played.

- country: "Bosnia and Herzegovina"
  song: "Ljubav Je"
  artist: "Dalal & Deen"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    A terribly unexciting duet. I'd have expected a track this dull in the early 2000's. The rap came from nowhere and fails to impress.

- country: "Malta"
  song: "Walk On Water"
  artist: "Ira Losco"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    If you ever bought an Ibiza remix CD when they were a thing, you know what this is like. Good vocals, rhythm and pacing. Solid track.


- country: "Latvia"
  song: "Heartbeat"
  artist: "Justs"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    This sounds like the musical love child of Bastille and Boy George. It's all pretty psychedelic; in a good way.

- country: "Poland"
  song: "Color Of Your Life"
  artist: "Michał Szpak"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    I'm not sure what metaphor Michał is going for, but regardless, this is a pretty dull. I suspect this will be knocked out in the semi-final.

- country: "Switzerland"
  song: "The Last Of Our Kind"
  artist: "Rykka"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    I have very little to say about this. I enjoyed the nap I had whilst it was on.

- country: "Israel"
  song: "Made Of Stars"
  artist: "Hovi Star"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    If Hovi is a Star, he's a fading star that's imploding into irrelevance.

- country: "Belarus"
  song: "Help You Fly"
  artist: "IVAN"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    I can imagine this could have been a better song with a better singer. That said, excellent use of electric guitar and synth.

- country: "Serbia"
  song: "Goodbye (Shelter)"
  artist: "Sanja Vučić ZAA"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    The vocalist in this song is superb; and she knows how to pull off a good key change. It'll never win but it might get through to the final.

- country: "Ireland"
  song: "Sunlight"
  artist: "Nicky Byrne"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Ireland's firmly in late-90s boyband territory here; late-90s singer, late-90s song, late-90s cheese. It's more Bryan Adams than Westlife.

- country: "Macedonia"
  song: "Dona"
  artist: "Kaliopi"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    I've got to sit through this at least once, possibly twice; and that doesn't make me happy.

- country: "Lithuania"
  song: "I've Been Waiting for This Night"
  artist: "Donny Montell"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Amongst a pack of slightly-dancey-drum-heavy ballads, this is just *meh*. It builds fairly well, but the ending is too abrupt.

- country: "Australia"
  song: "Sound of Silence"
  artist: "Dami Im"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    When you've only 3 minutes, you need to build momentum more quickly than this song. I can't tell if this a power ballad or a club anthem.

- country: "Slovenia"
  song: "Blue and Red"
  artist: "ManuElla"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    This is one of the least imaginative sets of lyrics in a Eurovision song for a while. Which would be fine, but the song is also uninspiring.

- country: "Romania"
  song: "Moment of Silence"
  artist: "Ovidiu Anton"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Someone sign this guy up for a Broadway musical. I'm sure the theatrics with this will be a joy to watch. Bravo.

- country: "Bulgaria"
  song: "If Love Was A Crime"
  artist: "Poli Genova"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Three words: Bloody. Good. Tune.

    This is a song to put an arena in a party mood. It reminds me of [Beyoncé](http://youtu.be/VBmMU_iwe6U) and [Galantis](http://youtu.be/5XR7naZ_zZA).

- country: "Denmark"
  song: "Soldiers of Love"
  artist: "Lighthouse X"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    If Boyzone met One Direction and had gaybies, this would be the result. Unoriginal, but definitely catchy. Disappointing lack of key change.

- country: "Ukraine"
  song: "1944"
  artist: "Jamala"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    This is as morbid as a dead duck floating upside down in a pond.   The duck was probably killed by the hideous screaming at the end.

- country: "Norway"
  song: "Icebreaker"
  artist: "Agnete"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    The verses and the chorus in this sound like two completely different songs; both independently brilliant, but terrible together.

- country: "Georgia"
  song: "Midnight Gold"
  artist: "Nika Kocharov and Young Georgian Lolitaz"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    This starts as a polished rock number reminiscent of the Arctic Monkeys, and then completely loses its shit, like [Muse](http://youtu.be/Q3Yc3HhSl1Q) on acid. Bonkers.

- country: "Albania"
  song: "Fairytale"
  artist: "Eneda Tarifa"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Way to waste a moody opening! The verses aren't very catchy and the chorus is just whiny. I don't hate it, but can't say anything positive.

- country: "Belgium"
  song: "What's The Pressure"
  artist: "Laura Tesoro"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    10 seconds in, my only comment is this: hell yes.

    This is 70s disco mixed with Mark Ronson and Fleur East. Superb effort, Belgium.

- country: "France"
  song: "J'ai cherché"
  artist: "Amir"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    It's unusual to hear English lyrics in the French entry, but it's another conservative choice for France. At least it's not another ballad.

- country: "Germany"
  song: "Ghost"
  artist: "Jamie-Lee"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    This had all the elements it needed to work, but it just doesn't. What could've been a solid competitor ends up as a squandered opportunity.

- country: "Italy"
  song: "No Degree Of Separation"
  artist: "Francesa Michielin"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    This is a total let down after [mini Il Divo](http://youtu.be/w1f6o1HQBvg) last year. It's gratuitous instrumentation is uninspiring at best; an ear-assault at worst.

- country: "Spain"
  song: "Say Yay!"
  artist: "Barei"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Yes, Spain! This is everything I want from Euro-pop: catchy, full of bass and camp as Christmas.

- country: "Sweden"
  song: "If I Were Sorry"
  artist: "Frans"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Sweden just has a knack of producing pop songs that are on point; and this is another. This sounds like it's from Coldplay's latest album.

- country: "United Kingdom"
  song: "You're Not Alone"
  artist: "Joe and Jake"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    I maintain this is a weak choice compared with others the UK could've picked; but it's not awful, and it'll probably get the 1D-tween vote.

The Eurovision Song Contest's 2016 album, featuring all the acts entering the contest this year, was released yesterday. With the exception of the UK entry, I've deliberately avoided listening to this year's line up until today.

In 140 characters or fewer, here are my first impressions of each of the 43 entries.
