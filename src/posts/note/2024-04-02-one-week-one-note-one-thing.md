This week, I'm going to start to weeknote.[^verb] 

I've created a new post format and [a page where all my weeknotes will go](/weeknotes). Now I just need to do it!

I don't know what I'll weeknote about yet. Probably some work stuff. Maybe some personal stuff. Definitely some random side hustling.

But I want to make this habit stick. My time is finite, and if this turns into war and peace each week, I'll never stick to it.

So I'm going to set my sights deliberately low. 

I will write one note each week, on a Friday afternoon. I will constrain that one note to one thing I have taken away from that one week.

The task starts this Friday. Let’s see how it goes!



[^verb]: How do you write “weeknote”? ”Weeknote” or a “weeknote”? Is it a noun or a verb, or both? Do you “write a weeknote” or is it possible “to weeknote”? Maybe I need a style guide.
