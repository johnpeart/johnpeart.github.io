This is quite possibly the hardest *PlayStation* Platinum trophy I have yet to achieve. 

*Bloodborne* is a game of aggressive persistence. Where *Elden Ring* offers a wide variety of play styles, paths and tactics to achieve an objective and progress, *Bloodborne* forces you to keep smashing your head against the wall until you break through it.

Like I did with *Elden Ring*, I bounced off of this game multiple times. I could not get into the rhythm or flow of the combat, which relies heavily on parry mechanics – something I definitively suck at. But I came back again, starting just before Halloween, and I persisted.

First, I battled my way through the core game. Then I have battled my way through the *Chalice Dungeons*, and then finally to the remaining two endings via *New Game+*. Whilst I generally dislike having to replay games just for the sake of additional trophies; at least in *FromSoft* games you get a truly different experience each time.

The hardest part of the whole game was definitely the *Chalice Dungeons*. Even with a massively over-levelled character in *New Game+* the “Cursed and Defiled Chalice” dungeon – which reduces your accumulated health by 50%, resulting in consistent one- or two-hit deaths if you make a mistake – was gruelling and torturous. Also there were *way* too many spiders without the ability to turn them off or switch them out for something less spider-y[^1].

What makes this game gripping though is the setting. I'm usually drawn to science-fiction worlds more than historical and period settings; but *Bloodborne* kind of mashes the two. It's a Victorian-era themed, cosmic-horror narrative. So much goes unexplained in the story, but nonetheless what little I gleaned had me rivetted.

Is the nightmare real? How did I get there? Are the other people in this shared reality figments of the world or other people caught in a shared nightmare? What are the Amygdalas? Why are people turning into beasts? So... many... questions...

This may have been the hardest of my Platinums, but I also think it's one of the best games I've ever played.
