This may not be a game made by *FromSoftware*, but the game developers clearly understand the *Soulsborne* formula.

It's buttery-smooth graphics, dark storytelling, and easy-to-learn but challenging-to-master combat combine to make a brilliant romp through a steampunk retelling of Carlo Collodi's *Pinocchio*. It rips.

More than one playthrough is obligatory to see the full story, which gets deeper, darker and more sad on the second run. At least three end-to-end runs are required for this *Platinum* trophy but with the incremental unveiling of the story and with the satisfying gameplay loop, it never feels like a chore.
