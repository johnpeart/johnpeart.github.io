A new year is here. That means it's time for some new goal setting.

2021 was a qualified success; I achieved most of [what I set out to](/2022/01/01/setting-goals-for-2022) in spirit, even if not in practice. I'm hoping that in 2022, I can do better.

## Some parameters for this go round

I'm generally a pessimist, but even *I* didn't expect the pandemic to still be plaguing our daily lives almost two years on. It's been a drag on us all generally and on my focus specifically.

So, for 2022, I'm going to keep things simple. Nothing drastic. I'm going to focus on 4 simple things to make me a bit happier.

## My goals for 2022

### 1. Save some money

I am, frankly, sick of paying someone else's mortgage. It's time to get a mortgage of my own. I've got most of the money I need, but I'd like a buffer. By the end of *2023* I'm going to aim to buy something. This year though, I want to round out my savings. 

My goal is simple: save £5,000 this year. That works out to just over £400 a month. I've done it before; I can do it again! 

> **Success measure:** £5,000 saved

### 2. Write more

For 3 of the last 4 years, I've had a pretty good streak of writing going on this very blog. 2021 broke that streak, but I will not be defeated! I like writing stuff, I am going to challenge myself to get back into the rhythm of it.

> **Success measure:** write 12 blog posts

### 3. Close my activity rings

I'm not getting any younger and my body knows it. I do a lot of sitting down. I need to be more active to stay healthy (and probably also see a chiropractor).

I have an Apple Watch that tracks my daily activity in 3 ways: 

- standing for 1 minute every hour, at least 12 times a day
- doing 30 minutes exercise a day
- burning a chosen number of active calories everyday – for me, that's 500 calories

So this goal is straightforward. Do those 3 things at least 5 times a week.

> **Success measure:** close my activity rings at least 5 days a week all year

### 4. Weigh less

I have a much healthier relationship with food and am much happier with my body image today than I was 2 years ago. I lost more than 10kg in 2020. 2021 saw a slight backslide, however, so I'd like to tip the balance back in the other direction.

My goal is to lose 5 kilograms, taking me comfortably under my target weight, whilst staying comfortably above my healthy minimum weight.

> **Success measure:** 5 kilograms lost

## May the odds be ever in my favour

So that's it. Four simple goals, 365 days. Let's get to it!
