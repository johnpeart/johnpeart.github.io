Today, there are 64 Members of Parliament who are LGBT+. Tomorrow, when Parliament dissolves ahead of the General Election on 4 July, there will be *none*. 

How many will there be in total when the next Parliament forms a few days later? I've no idea, but with your help, we can figure it out.

Since 2017, I've been maintaining a public registry of [members of the UK Parliament who are openly LGBT+](https://www.lgbt.mp/)[^lgbt]. 

It’s not just a list; it’s a *live* list. It is designed to show who is LGBT+ *at the moment you're looking at it*. 

I've written before about [why I created this dataset](/2020/02/24/making-a-dataset-of-lgbt-mps/). It started out of work-related necessity. Now I'm keeping track because people have seem to find it useful. The dataset has been [used by the BBC, Sky News, the United Nations, and others](https://www.lgbt.mp/about/), and about 1,000 people a month visit the website.

## A big task ahead

There is a lot of work to do over the next couple of months to keep this dataset up-to-date and complete.

The task in front of me is to check:

- whether any current LGBT+ MPs are standing down
- which current LGBT+ MPs are standing again for election, and whether they get re-elected
- every newly elected MP and whether any of them are LGBT+

On top of all that, there are constituency boundary changes too, so even if an MP is returning to Parliament, their constituency might have changed.

*Oh boy, is there a lot of work to do*!

## Can you help?

If you know an MP in the upcoming Parliament is LGBT+ and you have a reliable public source to back that up, I need you!

I've set up 3 new online forms to gather data about new, returning or leaving LGBT+ MPs. You'll need a free Github account to use them.

- [Suggest an MP to **add** the dataset](https://github.com/johnpeart/lgbt-mp/issues/new?assignees=johnpeart&labels=Add+MP&projects=&template=add-mp.yml&title=Add+an+MP%3A+%5BReplace+with+full+name+of+MP%5D)
- [Suggest an MP to **remove** from the dataset](https://github.com/johnpeart/lgbt-mp/issues/new?assignees=johnpeart&labels=Remove+MP&projects=&template=remove-mp.yml&title=Remove+an+MP%3A+%5BReplace+with+full+name+of+MP%5D)
- [**Update** an MP that is already in the dataset](https://github.com/johnpeart/lgbt-mp/issues/new?assignees=johnpeart&labels=Edit+MP&projects=&template=update-mp.yml&title=Update+an+MP%3A+%5BReplace+with+full+name+of+MP%5D)

If you're struggling with the forms, you can also email me at <data@whoare.lgbt>.


[^lgbt]: By LGBT+, I mean the broadest possible definition of the term; lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans, or any other minority sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or variation of sex characteristics.
