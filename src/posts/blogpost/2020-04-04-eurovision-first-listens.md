eurovision-entries:
- country: "Australia"
  emoji: "üá¶üá∫"
  song: "Don't Break Me"
  artist: "Montaigne"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    The Aussies keep churning out Eurovision class acts; this year is no exception. This is a cool and punchy track that makes great use of text painting in the lyrics to compliment the swooping instrumentation. It rises and falls throughout to keep you engaged for all three minutes.

- country: "Azerbaijan"
  emoji: "üá¶üáø"
  song: "Cleopatra"
  artist: "Efendi"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    I always thought Cleopatra was Egyptian and yet, despite Egypt being eligible to enter Eurovision, this ode to the queen comes from Azerbaijan.

    Obviously inspired by [last year‚Äôs fan favourite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovt7YGHAj8I), it‚Äôs replete with faux-throat singing, but with substantially more sex and sass. Solid.

- country: "Belarus"
  emoji: "üá¶üáø"
  song: "Da vidna"
  artist: "VAL"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    *Da vidna*, meaning ‚Äúuntil dawn‚Äù is reminiscent of that track from *Made in Chelsea*. You know, [the one with the screechy sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX3k_QDnzHE).

    *Made in Chelsea* and *Da vidna* have something else in common too: they‚Äôre both stilted and devoid of substance.

- country: "Belgium"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Release Me"
  artist: "Hooverphonic"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    You know when you‚Äôre in a pub and you ask for Coke but you get Pepsi? Sure it looks like Coke, but the taste? Just a bit *off*. That‚Äôs this song.

    It‚Äôs almost a good jazz lounge number. It‚Äôs *fine*. It‚Äôs just a bit discordant and, like Pepsi, a poor imitation of the original.

- country: "Croatia"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Divlji vjetre"
  artist: "Damir Ked≈æo"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    As it‚Äôs sung in Croatian, I‚Äôve taken the liberty of looking up the lyrics for this one. What I‚Äôm getting is pathetic; a pathetic fallacy that is.

    It‚Äôs also naff.

    This is basically [that song from Pocahontas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9MvdMqKvpU&feature=youtu.be&t=70) but without the colonial overtones or the musical genius of Alan Menken.

- country: "Cyprus"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Running"
  artist: "Sandro"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    I *think* what we‚Äôre meant to take away from this song is that this artist is struggling with his mental health. (*Great! #TimeToTalk etc.*)

    What I *actually* took away from this is that maybe Sandro is *really* into marathons. I do like this, I just think it gets a *little* repetitive.

- country: "Ireland"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Story of My Life"
  artist: "Lesley Roy"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Well Lesley *clearly* likes P!nk.

    I‚Äôm not much of a P!nk fan, but I can appreciate a thumping good pop song and *this* is one of those. It‚Äôs uptempo, chirpy, and has a driving bass line for a fun three minutes.

- country: "Israel"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Feker libi"
  artist: "Eden "
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    *Feker libi* (or ‚Äúmy sweetheart‚Äù in English) is a very confused song. One minute it‚Äôs a 90s house track, praying to the Earth mother; the next it‚Äôs a Bollywood banging [Pussycat Dolls rip-off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc5OyXmHD0w).

    If you can look past the frantic and a bit out-of-place middle-eight, it‚Äôs pretty good!

- country: "Lithuania"
  emoji: ""
  song: "On Fire"
  artist: "The Roop"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    I so desperately wanted to make a good ‚Äú*The Roop* is *On Fire*‚Äù joke here, but this track does not deserve my best wit. This is quirky and there‚Äôs an ear-worming synth riff throughout, but it does not exceed the sum of its parts. Disappointing, at best.

- country: "Malta"
  emoji: ""
  song: "All of My Love"
  artist: "Destiny"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    The song builds very quickly from a quiet piano ballad, to a powerhouse with drivingly rhythmic instrumentation. It‚Äôs hard to identify the catchy riff that your ear is meant to latch on to, but there‚Äôs no doubting that singer, Destiny, has got *lungs*.

- country: "North Macedonia"
  emoji: ""
  song: "You"
  artist: "Vasil"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    The recently renamed ~~Former Yugoslav Republic of~~ North Macedonia has ditched boastful ballads this year and gone for a sexed-up, Latino-type song about dancing.

    The vocals are a tad bland, but the instrumentation is varied and lay down a fun beat.

- country: "Norway"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Attention"
  artist: "Ulrikke"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    ‚ÄúI just want your attention‚Äù, sings Ulrikke in the pre-chorus of the Norwegian entry. Well, Ulrikke, you‚Äôll have to try harder than this.

    The song takes an age to get started, and it only really grabs you after about 2 minutes. It‚Äôs pleasant enough; just not very catchy.

- country: "Romania"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Alcohol You"
  artist: "Roxen"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    What is Roxen drinking?

    If this were any true metaphor for alcohol, it would feel a lot better in the moment and the hangover would at least be memorable. This dreary and confused entry is closer to drinking bleach than alcohol; it‚Äôs shit and you‚Äôll regret it once it‚Äôs done.

- country: "Russia"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Uno"
  artist: "Little Big"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    It has been apparent for sometime that things are *not good* in Russia, but now we know why: they‚Äôre still living in the 1990s.

    This, somehow, manages to be *even more annoying* than [Aqua‚Äôs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_(band)) infamous back catalogue, which ‚Äì let‚Äôs not forget ‚Äì includes a song about [plastic dolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie_Girl).

- country: "Slovenia"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Voda"
  artist: "Ana Sokliƒç"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Who knew that the Slovenians were so enthusiastic about one [the world‚Äôs largest telecommunications companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vodafone)?

    In reality, I have absolutely no idea what the lyrics to this song are about, as I can‚Äôt find the English translation; but it is inoffensive enough to pass three minutes.

- country: "Sweden"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Move"
  artist: "The Mamas"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    [Last year‚Äôs Swedish backing singers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEEuG5XML-A) would have taken centre-stage this year in this soul and gospel track.

    This is another great entry in a string of amazing Eurovision entries from my favourite European nation. I am unashamedly biased at this point. Sweden can do no wrong!

- country: "Ukraine"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Solovey"
  artist: "Go_A"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Oh [Christ on a hamster wheel](https://youtu.be/slHboKF9PIQ?t=12), didn‚Äôt we collectively learn *anything* from this style of music [last year](https://youtu.be/IEu0F5uobVo?t=8)?

    According to their [official profile](https://eurovision.tv/participant/go_a), Go_A think that ‚ÄúUkrainian folklore and electronic music are a perfect match‚Äù. They are wrong. Go_Away. Now.


- country: "Austria"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Alive"
  artist: "Vincent Bueno"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Bare with this, because the first 30 seconds are a bit crap. They‚Äôre obscuring some excellent bass-thwacking that comes a little later.

    It‚Äôs a bit all over the place and can‚Äôt catch a consistent feeling of pace, but it‚Äôs enough to jolt you awake after some snoozing ballads.

- country: "Albania"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Fall from the Sky"
  artist: "Arilena Ara"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    This song takes a while to get going. The first two verses and choruses are basically a write-off.

    Yes, that‚Äôs most of the song but then, then there is the final bridge and final chorus. They‚Äôre punchy, dramatic, and *probably not worth the wait* but I enjoyed them anyway.

- country: "Armenia"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Chains on You"
  artist: "Athena Manoukian"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    The Armenians have apparently discovered the existence of steel drums, unambiguously sadomasochistic lyrics, and contemporary hip-hop. So basically the artist thinks she‚Äôs Rihanna. Except, you know, without all the production value or [the Pitch Perfect spin-offs](https://youtu.be/jI6jGlQhTU4?t=132).

- country: "Bulgaria"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Tears Getting Sober"
  artist: "Victoria"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Bulgaria has had some absolute *tunes* in recent years. (See [2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQqUTigWKHY), [2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMmm-G078LM), and [2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC-1tdGDFQc).) But then, last year, they didn‚Äôt enter and I was gutted. Having heard this, I wish they‚Äôd skipped another year.

    It‚Äôs weird. It‚Äôs incoherent. It‚Äôs barely instrumented. I don‚Äôt like it. [Bring back Poli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQqUTigWKHY)!

- country: "Czech Republic"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Kemama"
  artist: "Benny Cristo"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    The Czech‚Äôs have been on an upward trajectory the last few years. [Last year‚Äôs entry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJxLKFZKhNs) was great, if you ignored the [shit cockney accent](https://youtu.be/NJxLKFZKhNs?t=37).

    This year‚Äôs entry is also pretty good. And it‚Äôs produced by someone called *Glowsticks*, which is just *extremely* on brand for Eurovision.

- country: "Denmark"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Yes"
  artist: "Ben & Tan"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    The Danes have apparently taken inspiration from their near-*ish* Dutch neighbours with this country song that sounds remarkably similar to [a Lumineers track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCBSSwgtg4) in the chorus.

    It‚Äôs a ‚Äúyes‚Äù from me.

- country: "Estonia"
  emoji: ""
  song: "What Love Is"
  artist: "Uku Suviste"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    I‚Äôm a sucker for a good power ballad and *this* is *not a good power ballad*. It has all the right components: a slow opening, kicking into a bold chorus. When it comes to it though, it never *truly* lets rip and that‚Äôs why it fails.

- country: "Finland"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Looking Back"
  artist: "Aksel"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Given the only winning entry Finland‚Äôs ever had in Eurovision was a bunch of [hard rocking, latex monsters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAh9NRGNhUU), this is about as far away from that as you can get. That is to say it is comparatively dull.

    Unrelatedly, I can‚Äôt excuse Aksel‚Äôs *laissez-faire* view of motoring offences.

- country: "Georgia"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Take Me as I Am"
  artist: "Tornike Kipiani"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    This guy seems not to have gotten over his latest relationship breakdown.

    Why do I say that? Well, it‚Äôs obviously *totally proportionate* to release a song where you scream ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you love me?‚Äù into a microphone as part of a grunge track.

    Awkward.

- country: "Greece"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Supergirl"
  artist: "Stefania"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Top marks for the obvious message of womens‚Äô empowerment contained in this track‚Äôs lyrics.

    The song has a driving rhythm and some peculiar backing music replete with some kind of presumably Greek-native instrument; but there‚Äôs nothing that stands out as particularly interesting.

- country: "Iceland"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Think About Things"
  artist: "Da√∞i og Gagnamagni√∞"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    I don‚Äôt care what anyone else says, this is *fucking brilliant*.  It‚Äôs got whimsy lyrics, 1980s stylings to the instrumentation, and a top-notch beat. Oh, *and* it‚Äôs got a totally insane slowed-down-and-then-sped-up bridge into the final chorus. *Douze points!*

- country: "Latvia"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Still Breathing"
  artist: "Samanta Tƒ´na"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    One of two tracks this year with an unfortunate title, given *the situation*. (You know, literally [the reason the contest has been cancelled](https://eurovision.tv/story/eurovision-2020-in-rotterdam-is-cancelled)!)

    Latvia takes us to the club with this over-produced track and nondescript female vocal. It throws in some (not good) rap near the end of the track before crashing into a distorted mess of an ending.

- country: "Moldova"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Prison"
  artist: "Natalia Gordienko"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    This is a fairly *meh* pop ballad from the Moldovans. It keeps rolling with a decent ebb and flow, switching up between piano-leading verses and more punchy choruses. It‚Äôs enough to keep you interested, but it‚Äôs ultimately a bit anti-climactic.

- country: "Poland"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Empires"
  artist: "Alicja"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Singer Alicja appears to be quite pre-occupied with combustion in this kind-of-orchestrally instrumented track. There are a lot of destructive metaphors.

    It‚Äôs kind of like a James Bond theme, if Bond themes were a bit shit and done on a shoe string rather than by [drag queens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaolVEJEjV4).

- country: "Portugal"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Medo de sentir"
  artist: "Elisa"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Ah, Portugal. Another year, another expectedly dreary entry.

    It‚Äôs a ballad. It‚Äôs very monotone. It would have been a good moment to pop to the loo because you wouldn‚Äôt have missed much.

- country: "San Marino"
  emoji: ""
  song: "FREAKY!"
  artist: "Senhit"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    San Marino, the tiny nation always churning out *questionable* acts that for some reason people seem to like, have discovered the 1970s this year. It‚Äôs a discotheque tune with a *lot* repetition of the word ‚Äúfreaky‚Äù. By my count, there are no fewer than 41 uses of ‚Äúfreaky‚Äù and 6 uses of ‚Äúfreaking‚Äù in this freaking song. For once for San Marino, something I‚Äôd listen to again.

- country: "Serbia"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Hasta la vista"
  artist: "Hurricane"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    This song *starts* with a false-*stop* and I am not a fan. What I am a fan of is the high-energy *hasta la vistas* peppered throughout this early-2000s style, girl-band song.

    Objectively, it‚Äôs probably *not a good song*, but it‚Äôs got a fun Eurovision prime-era vibe to it.

- country: "Switzerland"
  emoji: ""
  song: "R√©pondez-moi"
  artist: "Gjon‚Äôs Tears"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    This is a very emotive entry. There‚Äôs something haunting about Gjon‚Äôs voice, and the stripped back instrumentation compliments his falsetto in interesting ways. It is also in French, which is novel for a Swiss entry nowadays.

- country: "France"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Mon alli√©e (The Best in Me)"
  artist: "Tom Leeb"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    You can always rely on the French for a meandering ballad, and this year they‚Äôve delivered in spades. Unless my ears deceive me, I think there are *two* key changes (top work, France). The lyrics, however, are awfully gushing and the song itself is just colourless.

- country: "Germany"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Violent Thing"
  artist: "Ben Dolic"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    There‚Äôs one reliable thing about a nation that regularly doesn‚Äôt *open* its nightclubs until after midnight, and it‚Äôs that it knows how to throw a party. The Germans have brought this fun, slick bop to *this* party and it is totally my vibe. It could have been a contender.

- country: "Italy"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Fai rumore"
  artist: "Diodato"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Italy has [good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TOMqZV2jA8) [years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-aoyPa41Ic) and [bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81M-mp5t8uM) [years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfnhDfy8AjU). This, I think, is a bad year.

    It‚Äôs basically just a middle-aged, white guy shouting at a microphone too much for three-minutes. Par for the course for Italy in the 2010s, but not a great start to the 2020s.

- country: "Netherlands"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Grow"
  artist: "Jeangu Macrooy"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    This is utterly miserable. For the first minute and a half it‚Äôs almost one continuous note of instrumentation with a near monotone vocal.

    After that, it just gets *weird*. It very, *very* slowly builds to a crescendo and just as you think it might be getting *somewhere*; it stops.

- country: "Spain"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Universo"
  artist: "Blas Cant√≥"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    This song is a great example of how lyrics can sound really impressive in their native language, and then turn to utter gibberish when translated into English.

    There is an excellent falsetto at 2:30 that I bet would have gotten *totally butchered* live. Gutted we‚Äôll miss that.

- country: "United Kingdom"
  emoji: ""
  song: "My Last Breath"
  artist: "James Newman"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    It‚Äôs supremely unfortunate that in the year the UK enters a *good* song, Eurovision gets cancelled. It‚Äôs also unfortunate that we chose a song with *this title* in the same year the world is swept by a respiratory virus pandemic.

    I just wish the song didn‚Äôt end 25 seconds early.

summing-up: | 
    So that‚Äôs every Eurovision song that won‚Äôt get to compete this year. 41 tracks that history will probably forget. In many cases, probably for the best anyway.
---

The Eurovision Song Contest will not take place in 2020. At least, not as we know it. The songs will be ‚Äúhonoured‚Äù in a special two-hour event in May. *I know. I‚Äôm sad too.*

This year would have seen 41 countries put forward up to 3:00 minutes of something resembling popular music. All 41 entries are now never to be voted upon ‚Äì *except in my virtual house party, of course*.

Every year for the last 5 years, it‚Äôs been a tradition of mine to listen to the tracks on the official Eurovision album and jot down some initial impressions. This year it‚Äôs not clear if we‚Äôre going to *get* an official album, so instead I‚Äôve scoured the internet to listen to them on a self-compiled Eurovision playlist instead. The coronavirus can‚Äôt stop me unashamedly enjoying the musical delights of a slightly geographically-expanded Europe.

As ever, there are some rules:

1. I'm only allowed to listen to each track once
2. Each entry is allowed a tweet-sized piece of commentary: up to 280 characters ‚Äî no more, but sometimes less

In lieu of an officially curated album, I‚Äôve listened to the songs in alphabetical order *by artist* this year.

So let‚Äôs hop in...
