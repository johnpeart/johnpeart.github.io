      The register of digital identity and attribute services is now in public beta. This means it’s easier for businesses and the public to check and find trusted digital identity products across the UK.

It's now easier than ever to find services that meet the rules in the UK digital identity and attributes trust framework, as our new GOV•UK register has now entered public beta. 

This is a huge leap forward compared to what we had before; no more weird spreadsheets!

I'd love to know what you think of this new service and what you'd like to see us add to this service as we continue to develop it over the next year.
