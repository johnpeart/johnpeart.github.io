This year, for the second time, I publicly set myself some goals for the year ahead. New Year’s resolutions but in the open, so that I'm accountable to whoever was checking in.

In 2018, I failed at basically all of them. Nonetheless, [I took away a feeling of accomplishment](/2018/12/16/ive-failed-my-2018-goals). For 2019, I set out to improve on the formula by making my objectives SMART[^1], and by setting a broader range of goals. 

I ended up with 6 goals:

1. quit Facebook
2. write at least 12 blog posts
3. learn to ride a bike
4. start a podcast
5. save £5,000 by 31 December 2019
6. be physically active for 30 minutes every day

I deliberately set myself stretching goals so that I could get away with some slippage and still get the sense of accomplishment from having done lots. Success, therefore, is if I complete 80% of a goal. 

## How did I do?

It is 26 December 2019, and as I write this, **I have achieved two of my goals** and I've made substantial progress in achieving a third. Go me!

Let’s break it down. 

### No more Facebook

At the end of last year I made the decision to quit Facebook.

The success criteria for this goal was to delete my Facebook account and not log in for 365 days. With only a couple of days to go, I think I can safely say **I have achieved 100% of this goal**.

Honestly, I don't miss it. It’s not a choice everyone feels they can make, but I'd say it has been a net positive for me.

### Keep writing blog posts

Last year I ridiculously said I'd write a blog post a week, but only managed to write 16. This year, my aim was to keep up that pace, and I have broadly have. 

The success criteria for this goal was to write and publish 12 blog posts. By the end of this month, I will have published 12 blog posts, meaning **I've achieved 100% of this goal**.

You can read all my blog posts, from this year — and all the way back to 2011 — over on my '[Writing](/writing)' page. 

### Learn to ride a bike

Success in this goal was simple; I aimed to correct a childhood mistake and learn to ride a bike. 

It sounded simple, but I did not account for two things:

1. my crippling social embarrassment of practising doing this in public
2. my own laziness

The mistake remains unfixed; and I doubt it ever will be.

### Start a podcast

I had a [great idea for this](/2019/01/27/department-of-bad-ideas). I [set up](/2019/02/11/department-of-bad-ideas-hosting-and-website) [a website](https://podcast.johnpe.art/), and even recorded a preview episode before getting it listed on the [Apple Podcasts](https://pcr.apple.com/id1451459867) and Spotify podcast listings. What I didn't do, was actually finish the job. 

Success here was defined as recording and publishing 5 episodes.  I put in a substantial amount of preparatory work here, but I have published no episodes. So **I'm going to say this is 15% done**, and I'm going to roll it over to next year.

### Save some money

I've made relative progress here compared to 2018. Then, I saved basically no money over the year. I wanted a do-over for 2019, and I've saved a good chunk of money in doing so. 

The success criteria for this goal was to save £5,000. Keeping track of that is a bit messy because my bank accounts are generally a mess, but I think I've saved at least £1,900 this year. **That’s 38% of my goal achieved**; a substantial increase on last year, even with some big ticket purchases throughout the year.

It’s challenging saving money but I'm going to stick at it again for 2020!

### Exercise more

My previous goals focused on exercised have zeroed in on running as a method of exercise, but I find myself both uninterested in it and incapable of doing it thanks to a recurring knee injury. I abandoned the idea for this year, and instead decided to focus on being generally active in day-to-day life.

The success criteria for this goal is defined as 30 minutes for activity a day, as tracked by my Apple Watch. With a few days to go, I have on average this year been active at least 5 out of 7 days each week. That means **I've achieved around 70% of this goal**. 

I'm pretty happy with that, but I can and should do more given my youth is slipping away from me. I'll try to be a bit more proactive, rather than passive, with exercise for 2020.

## Not too shabby

Overall, I think I've done substantially better at making progress against this year’s goals than I did with last year's. Whilst only 2 goals meet the definition of 'done', I came very close to success on a third goal, and two others I made substantial inroads on. 

I'll be setting some more goals for 2020, because I think I can do better again next year. Now I just need to decide what they are.
