This week has been an incredibly busy week where I have done lots, but I can't really remember a lot of what I've done. I'm sure it was all important. I couldn't tell you what it was. We all have those weeks sometimes, that’s fine.

## Sticking out enough to be stickers

Two things this week stuck out enough that... well, I just had to turn them into stickers. 

The first I call “Friendly but socially awkward”.

The second, I call “Aubergine Dot Com”.[^1]

[^1]: Disclaimer: aubergine.com does exist. It seems rather more sedate than the conversation that led to this sticker, and has nothing to do with the actual website.

  <figcaption>“Aubergine Dot Com”, available in even more limited quantities, from me, soon.</figcaption>

I'm not going to explain what promoted me to create these stickers. But the stickers have been ordered and they are on their way. If you want one, let me know!

## A new LGBT+ MPs website

In the evenings this week and last, I've rebuilt the [LGBT+ Members of Parliament website](//www.lgbt.mp) using Eleventy instead of Jekyll. This has been my first time using Eleventy and I can't say I've enjoyed the complexity of the system, comparative to Jekyll, but it has certainly enabled me to do more creative things with the site.

The new website pulls data directly from the UK Parliament’s Members API to enable rich profiles for individual LGBT+ MPs, just like this one of [Lord Chris Smith of Finsbury](https://www.lgbt.mp/member/186/). 

I've also updated the permanent URL for the website. It’s no longer at “mps.whoare.lgbt”, but instead at the the much simpler [www.lgbt.mp](//www.lgbt.mp). I'm now dealing with the headache of redirects, but I think this will make it easier to tell people where to find the information.
