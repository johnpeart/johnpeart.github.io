You are a dog. Save the people.

That is the premise of this superb puzzle game that really shows off the power of the PS5. 

It's tough, but not too tough. 

It oozes charm and quirkiness. I was smiling like an idiot as the story and mechanics developed.

It took me about 14 hours to complete and get the Platinum. Only about half a dozen puzzles broke my patience, nudging me to look for hints as to the solution. 

Perhaps best of all, it's free to play via PlayStation Plus.

Highly recommend!
