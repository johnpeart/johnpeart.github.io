      Oh this is nice. 👍🏾

      I wonder how hard it would be to do this CSS spice to WordPress comments 🤔

[@starrwulfe]({{ page.reply_to.author.url }}) Thanks! I've not used Wordpress in a *long time*, but my website source code is all freely available on Github if you want to take a dive through.

[This Sass file](https://github.com/johnpeart/theme/blob/main/_sass/components/_webmentions.scss) contains the styles for the webmentions elements of the site.
