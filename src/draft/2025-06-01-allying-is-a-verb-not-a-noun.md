This month marks the anniversary of the Stonewall uprising; or as you might more commonly hear it referred to, “Pride Month”.

Several years ago, when I was working in DCMS, I was asked at the last minute to present to a directorate of around 100 civil servants about pride... in no more than 5 minutes.

No one likes listening to these kinds of presentations – including me. They invariably turn into a tedious history lesson. A well-meaning but ultimately ineffective use of 5 minutes.

So instead, I chose a different message. 

This is what I said to them[^adapted].

[^adapted]: I have recreated the slides I used, and slightly amended the speaking notes for clarity.
