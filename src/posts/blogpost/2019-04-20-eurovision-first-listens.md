eurovision-entries:
- country: "Cyprus"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Replay"
  artist: "Tamta"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Clearly drunk on last year’s near-miss with *Fuego*, Cyprus has doubled down on the fiery pop genre. So much so that large chunks of the song appear to be very, *very* similar to the almost-winning song. That’s alright though, this is a fun and punchy tune to bop to.

- country: "Montenegro"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Heaven"
  artist: "Dmol"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    This is a group affair, in 90s R&B styling, with a “local instrument” for good measure.

    It’s got me thinking of a word. You know... When the word means the opposite of something? *Antonyms*.

    That’s this song.

    The artists called it “Heaven”, but what they meant was ‌”Hell”. See? *Antonyms*.

- country: "Finland"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Look Away"
  artist: "Darude"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    As you would expect for a Darude track, this evokes strong 90s vibes. I, of course, missed the 90s club scene, being an actual child, but you get the point.

    When you’re the creator of the all-time trance epic that is *Sandstorm*, though, it’s all down hill from there; isn’t it?

- country: "Poland"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Fire of Love (Pali Sie)"
  artist: "Tulia"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    This sounds like a bunch of school kids singing in a playground with a soundtrack. It’s *annoying*.

    It has no discernible melodic quality, and the vocalists are seemingly relying on quantity over quality. I can only assume there’s some kind of gimmick to make up for the awful song.

- country: "Slovenia"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Sebi"
  artist: "Zara Kralj & Gašper Šantl"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    You remember those old O2 adverts? The ones with the crashing bubbles?

    This track just sounds like the background noise on one of those adverts. It’s forgettable. So forgettable, in fact, I blitzed through the whole track almost without registering it consciously in my brain.

- country: "Czech Republic"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Friend of a Friend"
  artist: "Lake Malawi"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    I wanted to like this. It started well — with a catchy beat — but then at 30 seconds into the track, something awful happens. The main vocalist appears to put on a shit, cockney accent and tries to rap.

    The main *riff-of-a-riff-of-a-riff* is pretty good; but *that accent*. *Eurgh*.

- country: "Hungary"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Az én apám"
  artist: "Joci Papai"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    From the translated lyrics, this appears to be a song about the artists dead father. Whilst that’s touching, tears do not equal points.

    I’d call this “traditionally Eastern European” in style. It’s singer is capable; there’s a decent riff, if you like the genre. That’s about it.

- country: "Belarus"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Like It"
  artist: "Zena"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    This is a classic case of *nominative determinism* if I’ve ever heard one. I *like it*!

    This dance number has a pretty good rhythm, and an irritatingly repetitious set of lyrics. I would be surprised if it was a high scorer, but it’s a potential floor filler.

- country: "Serbia"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Kruna"
  artist: "Nevena Božović"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Yet another poorly put together, slow and drab song. Whining vocals and an unimaginative melody punctuate this never-ending bore of a song.

    It tries to get going toward the end, but it’s a bit like trying to get a clapped-out banger up a very steep hill: you just can’t.

- country: "Belgium"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Wake Up"
  artist: "Eliot"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    The Belgians have come up with a half-baked bun with this one. The tempo and instrumentation is all over the ~~bakery~~ shop in this Bastille-like pop number.

    It’s erratic rhythm means you can never quite get into it’s disappointing groove.

- country: "Georgia"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Keep on going"
  artist: "Oto Nemsadze"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Another year, another utterly dismal entry from our friends in Georgia.

    It drags. It’s got some weird and strained vocals. It’s got boring instrumentation.

    With so many failed attempts in recent years, you’d think they’d get the message: *read the room, guys*!

- country: "Australia"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Zero Gravity"
  artist: "Kate Miller-Heidke"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Chalk and cheese. Drinking and driving. Socks and sandles. These are things that don’t go well together.

    Now we add to this list: “90s anthems” and “the operatic style”.

    Following several years of quality tunes, the Auss-*he*-*he*-*he*-*he*-ies have entered something bonkers.

- country: "Iceland"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Hatrið mun sigra"
  artist: "HATARI"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    WHAT. IS. THIS. HORROR. SHOW?!

    This is like Daft Punk meets Black Sabbath. There’s lots of very uncomfortable shouting in this song, followed by some pulsating and actually quite enjoyable electronic stylings.

    BUT. PLEASE. MAKE. THE. SHOUTING. STOP.

- country: "Estonia"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Storm"
  artist: "Victor Crone"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    If you like mash-ups of country and dance-pop and want to live like it’s 2013, pretending Avicii is still *a thing*; then this is the track for you!

    This charming, yet thumping number has lots to like. A good tune, some tacky and meaningless lyrics, and a decent vocal.

- country: "Portugal"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Telemóveis"
  artist: "Conan Osíris"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    What the *actual* fuck is this Portugal? As if Salvador Sobral wasn’t enough pain to inflict on the world; now you do *this*?

    I can’t even finish the song — I’ve actually skipped it. It’s that bad.

- country: "Greece"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Better Love"
  artist: "Katerine Duska"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Singing the missing 15th track from her debut album: it’s *Jess Glynne*! Except it isn’t; it’s someone called Katerine.

    This beaty pop-ballad is perhaps just about good enough to avoid the same fate as Jess Glynne’s back catalogue, providing the backing track for *Jet2*’s commercials.

- country: "San Marino"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Say Na Na Na"
  artist: "Serhat"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    This is another good example of *nominative determinism* on this year’s Eurovision soundtrack. To this, I say “nah nah nah”.

    How does a country with such a minuscule population produce *so many bad songs*? That’s what I’d like to know.

- country: "Armenia"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Walking Out"
  artist: "Srbuk"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    There. Are. Too. Many. False. Stops. In. This. Song.

    That aside; it’s pretty good. There’s a decent riff in the chorus, the vocalist has some kick and the music has bite. There’s even a well-landed key change to boot — the first of the album, though not the first one in the eventual running order.

- country: "Ireland"
  emoji: ""
  song: "22"
  artist: "Sarah McTernan"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Ireland’s run of teen boys singing ballads is over, replaced instead by a mid-tempo ode to Count Von Count.

    Why is “22” significant to Sarah?

    Is it the age of her lover? Or a hotel room number?

    Maybe we’ll never know. The song passes quickly without answers or a lasting impression.

- country: "Moldova"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Stay"
  artist: "Anna Odobescu"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    The Moldovan’s have given us a power ballad.

    *Yes! I love a power ballad.*

    Unfortunately it’s not a particularly *good* ballad. There’s a competent vocal on this track, but an utterly squandered key change. For a power ballad, it just lacks — well — power.

- country: "Switzerland"
  emoji: ""
  song: "She Got Me"
  artist: "Luca Hänni"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    It’s clear where the inspiration for this came from, and I’m sorry to say that the Swiss have finally caught up with the criminally bad tune, *Despacito*.

    This somehow manages to be *even more annoying* than that trash bag, with what I think are bag pipes screeching in the background.

- country: "Latvia"
  emoji: ""
  song: "That Night"
  artist: "Carousel"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    A lullaby country song is our gift from Latvia this year. By “gift” I mean like socks for Christmas: it’s good to get them, so you no longer have to buy some, but it’s nonetheless dull.

    That’s how I feel about this song. Pleasant enough — so thanks Latvia — but a snooze-fest.

- country: "Romania"
  emoji: ""
  song: "On a Sunday"
  artist: "Ester Peony"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    This is a heavy contrast track. It starts all light and acoustic, and then switches to heavy bass. And then it switches back. And then back again. And... you get the idea.

    The vocals are capable, and the melody is fun and edgy.

    It’s *alright*. A bit safe, perhaps. But alright.

- country: "Denmark"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Love is Forever"
  artist: "Leonora"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Oh Denmark: *what happened?*

    Last year you gave us dramatic Viking-Disney vibes; this year you give us Bargain Hunt Bjork. In four languages, no less.

    “Love is Forever” but thankfully this song is only for 3 minutes.

- country: "Sweden"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Too Late For Love"
  artist: "John Lundvik"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Thank God for Sweden, eh? Maybe I’m biased — I love Swedish pop — but this is *brilliant*.

    It’s a bit heavy on the false stops, but the gospel overtones and the catchy chorus are golden. It stands out, and I love it.

    *Douze points* to Sweden for me.

- country: "Austria"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Limits"
  artist: "PAENDA"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Big questions first: how do you pronounce “PAENDA”; is it the same as “panda”?

    Back to the track: this is all grotesquely wishy-washy. The whole thing — from vocals to soundtrack — is like a car boot sale version of an Ellie Goulding track.

- country: "Croatia"
  emoji: ""
  song: "The Dream"
  artist: "Roko"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Much like Roko, I have a dream. I dream of a ballad with soaring vocals and excellent lyrics; of awe inspiring vocals and epic proportions.

    This song is not that dream.

    No. This ballad has an above average vocalist, dull backing music, vacuous lyrics and a poor key change.

- country: "Malta"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Chameleon"
  artist: "Michela Pace"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Could we be headed to Malta in 2020? With this tune, amongst this pretty dull pack; maybe.

    This up-beat and wacky track has some interesting instrumentation, and it certainly isn’t dull. Whether it’s a bit *too* off-the-wall remains to be seen.

- country: "Lithuania"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Run with the Lions"
  artist: "Jurij Veklenko"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    A song to sway to!

    The melody is pleasing enough, with a fair-to-middling tempo to carry it along. The main riff in the chorus is a bit of an ear worm too.

    It does kind of fall apart in the middle-eight, breaking the flow of what otherwise is a well put together track.

- country: "Russia"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Scream"
  artist: "Sergey Lazarev"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    I expected greatness from Sergey. I mean, he gave us “You Are the Only One”, nearly breaking his own neck in the process. Instead? This ballad.

    What has happened to Russia the last couple of years? It used to produce class acts — now it’s produces songs barely worth the time.

- country: "Albania"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Kjethu Tokës"
  artist: "Jonida Maliqi"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    I searched for the words to describe my feelings towards this year’s Albanian entry. And I found them in the very first line of the lyrics! Loosely translated:

    *“You sing”*

    She does.

    *“And cry”*

    I did.

    Sometimes the jokes just sing themselves.

- country: "Norway"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Spirit in the Sky"
  artist: "KEiiNO"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    This is a floor filler that packs a punch. It’s messy — of that there’s no doubt — but it’s got spunk. The middle-eight is truly batshit crazy: which I like.

    My biggest critique is that it doesn’t make much use of there being two vocalists; barely a decent harmony in earshot.

- country: "Netherlands"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Arcade"
  artist: "Duncan Laurence"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Reading this, you might be thinking I hate slow songs: I don’t, I hate bad slow songs. I like *good* ones. *This* is a good one.

    Well produced, a good vocal, and some bare but effective instrumentation. There’s even some clapping.

    I doubt it’s a winner, but it’s a slow song done well.

- country: "North Macedonia"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Proud"
  artist: "Tamara Todevska"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    The newly renamed ~~Former Yugoslav Republic of~~ *North* Macedonia had a chance to show Europe what their new brand meant.

    How did it choose to celebrate this moment? With a song called “Proud”. One of the 7 deadly sins, but OK.

    What does it sound like? Sticking to a theme: *sloth*. This is *not* the way to do a rebrand.

- country: "Azerbaijan"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Truth"
  artist: "Chingiz"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    This is a catchy tune that I like. If I had to choose 3 words to describe this, they would be:

    1. Slick
    2. Bass
    3. Bop

    There’s a pretty catchy riff in this track, and the lyrics speak to me: “so shut up about it”.

- country: "Germany"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Sister"
  artist: "S!ster"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Having seen the name of the track and of the artist, I expected some kind of remix of a classic Nickelodeon show soundtrack. Instead, I got this dreary ballad.

    There are some nice two-part harmonies in here, and that’s probably the nicest thing I can say about it.

- country: "Israel"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Home"
  artist: "Kobi Marimi"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Our hosts have entered a song with a title that might be a *just a little* on the nose. The song itself is not a patch on the majesty of last year’s winner.

    Ok, it’s just shit. It takes almost two thirds of the song to get going, and even then it’s just dire. Utterly dire.

- country: "United Kingdom"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Bigger Than Us"
  artist: "Michael Rice"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    To describe this as a rejected X-Factor winner’s single does not do justice to this entry from these fair shores.

    The [polls already show](https://mobile.twitter.com/britainelects/status/863010662066343938) that lots of the UK want out of Eurovision. The least the Beeb could do is not fan the flames of such idiocy with entries like this!

    In fairness to the artist, the vocal is very good — I just wish the BBC would stop churning out such boring songs.

- country: "France"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Roi"
  artist: "Bilal Hassani"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Fuck me with a croissant; *it’s happened!* For the first time since *I don’t remember when* the French have an entry I actually *like*!

    It’s fresh, it’s got a decent pace, it’s got good a couple of good riffs and it’s bilingual! Aces. (*Who says the French don’t like singing in English?*)

- country: "Italy"
  emoji: ""
  song: "Soldi"
  artist: "Mahmood"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    In recent years Italy have gone from “crazy ape” to “drunk dad at a wedding”, and now to “rip off Liam Payne”.

    One mustn’t complain though. Whilst the lyrics are in Italian, they are at least (once translated) cogent and even powerful; a improvement on recent years. Pretty good!

- country: "Spain"
  emoji: ""
  song: "La Venda"
  artist: "Miki Núñez"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    *Sigh*. It’s hard to believe that the same country that produced Ruth Lorenzo, and the *epic* “Dancing in the Rain” also produced this *monstrosity*.

    OK, the positives: It is fast moving. It’s very Spanish. It’s *fun*, I guess. None of that negates the fact that it is a truly awful song.

summing-up: |
    So that’s it! All 41 entries in fewer than 280 characters each.
    
    As you might have guessed, I think this is going to be very, very, *very* long Contest, folks. There’s a higher-than-usual proportion of pretty bad ballads, and some unmoving dance tracks too. The semi-finals will *hopefully* chuck out most of the dreck, but it won’t be able to get rid of all of it.
    
    I’ll wrap up with some of my worst and best songs of the Contest, based purely on the album production.
    
    ### The Worst
    
    It’s a hotly contested field for the bottom of the pack this year. Ordinarily, I find a mere handful of songs that I genuinely despise, but this year, I think the worst tracks have to be:
    
    - Georgia
    - Israel
    - San Marino
    - Portugal
    - Poland
    
    Now, remember friends, that the worst songs aren’t necessarily they worst scoring songs: weird voting structures, international geo-politics, and wild cultural differences across Europe result in some strange outcomes. That said, those are the songs I liked the least.
    
    ### The Best
    
    I’ve started to get a pretty good ear for the top of the pack over the years, and whilst I could make an ill-informed attempt to predict the winner[^win], I won’t. Instead, I’ll pick out some songs I liked the most:
    
    - Sweden
    - Italy
    - Estonia
    - France
    - Azerbaijan
    
    *My* winner is Sweden; I love a good Swedish pop song, and I love the gospel tones in this. It’s very reminiscent of last year’s Austrian entry.
    
    But who is *actually* going to win? You decide! Tune in on 14, 16 and 18 May 2019.
    
    [^win]: I do actually have a pretty decent track record of predicting acts in the Top 5, and have called the winner in 4 of the last 7 years based on this once-only album listen — but let’s put that down to luck more than skill!

---

It’s almost that time of year again when we get to enjoy the collective musical efforts of the European continent (and Australia). That’s right; the Eurovision Song Contest is back, and this year our host city is Tel Aviv in Israel.

This year 41 countries have put forward 3:00 minutes of fun to entice your *douze points*. In this annual blog post — now in it’s *fifth* year — I’m going to preview, review and snark about them all, in an attempt to guide you through the best and worst of the Contest.

As ever, there are some rules:

1. I'm only allowed to listen to each track once, as they appear on the official Eurovision Song Contest album
2. Each entry is allowed a tweet-sized piece of commentary: up to 280 characters — no more, but sometimes less

I’ve listened to the songs in the order they appear on the [official Contest album](https://eurovision.lnk.to/ESC2019WE), but they’re presented below in alphabetical order.

So let’s hop in...
