The games in the *Super Mario Land* series that I played the most as a child were *Super Mario Land* and [*Super Mario Land 3: Wario Land*](/game/1728207180/). *Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins* isn't one I recall being able to play; I don't think we owned it and the chunks of the game I remember playing were almost certainly on a borrowed copy.

Well, I'm an adult now and that means I don't have to borrow copies any more; I can buy one! £10 from CEX. Bargain.

[A "DX" hack of the game](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3784/) has been developed by the retro gaming community, meaning not only can I play the game but I can create a *better* version of the game. This hack makes the game full colour and it removes bugs from the original game that caused slowdown and lag in the original title.

Unlike *Super Mario Land* – which doesn't really feel like other Mario games, either of the era or since – *6 Golden Coins* looks and plays like the Mario games most of us are familiar with across console generations. Clearly leaning heavily on inspiration from *Super Mario 3*, it introduces ‘proper’ Mario to the *Game Boy* and a game design and over-world map that are now staples of the series.

It's not all borrowed ideas from the *NES* shrunk down to a 160 by 144 pixel screen though. This is the game that introduced Wario; Mario's arch-nemesis. Without this game, there would be no *Super Mario Land 3: Wario Land*, or any of the other (to my mind inferior) Wario games that succeeded it.

Anyway, I got the 6 golden coins and I bullied Wario in the final castle level (with surprising ease, I might add; maybe I'm better at this gameing thing than I thought).
