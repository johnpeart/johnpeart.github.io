On Friday, I popped along to the Phoenix Theatre in Londonâ€™s West End to watch *Stranger Things: The First Shadow*.

I enjoyed *Stranger Things* on Netflix, and thought Season 4 in particular was brilliant. *First Shadow* expands on one of the plot points from that season.

I wouldn't say this was the best thing I've seen on stage[^1] but it was a great night. I wasn't expecting high theatre and I didn't *get* high theatre. What I was hoping for was some spectacular staging and special effects, and *oh, wow* did I get that! You wouldn't think a CGI-heavy TV show like *Stranger Things* would translate well to stage, but you'd be wrong.

[^1]: The best thing I've seen on stage was the revival of Chess that played for just five weeks at the English National Opera in 2018. It was so good, I went twice!
