In this role I led the passage of the Telecommunications (Security) Act 2021 through Parliament. I worked across a mutli-functional team of policy and legal colleagues, and across Whitehall, to ensure the government's interests in the Act were well represented and protected. I worked closely with ministers, helping them to develop narratives and strategies to ensure the Act achieved Royal Assent.
