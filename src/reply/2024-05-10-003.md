      When someone says “[Send me a (Web)mention](/note/1715258267/),” I like to oblige. I guess it’s my inner urge to test and help others test that’s driving this puppy. So, hi John.

p.s. I'm not sure why, but your author information (name, website, etc.) didn't come through with the Webmention. I found the [IndieWebify.me](https://indiewebify.me/validate-h-entry/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsimply.joejenett.com%2Fa-tester-of-sorts%2F) service to be helpful to iron out a lot of my own bugs (it took a *long* time to figure out!).
