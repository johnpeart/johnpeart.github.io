*Carrion* is a Metroidvania style game with a twist. Instead of playing the hero, you are the monster. You're the *Metroid*, not *Samas Arran*, to strain the metaphor.

This game doesn't outstay its welcome. It’s *just* long enough to be complex and interesting, but also *just* short enough that you don't start to tire of it.

I completed it and achieved the Platinum in one single run and in less than 6 hours. A perfectly sized and designed game.

And it only cost me £3.99 in a sale!
