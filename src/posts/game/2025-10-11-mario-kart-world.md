It's *Mario Kart*. How much more is there to say?

OK. Fine.

It's a good *Mario Kart* but not my favourite. 

The new open world format doesn't really add anything to the core gameplay loop. The connectedness of each track is fun, but the connections are too long and repetitive the tracks are then too short. 

Aside from that, it's not really any different from *Mario Kart 8*, which is probably *the* perfect *Mario Kart*.
