*Super Mario Land 3: Wario Land* is one of the earliest games I ever remember playing. 

I've recently replayed the game using my newly purchased [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket) and, some twenty-odd years later, it still holds up! 

The original *Wario Land* was a monochrome game, but I've been playing the game using a [ROM hacked version that adds colour](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/6683/).

On this latest play-through I've achieved what was previously impossible for 10-ish year old me: 100% completion.

Finish the game with 99,999 coins and all the collectables and Wario is rewarded with his own planet for a “perfect game”.
