    title: "We’ll sell 25 million PS5 consoles, no 21M, actually 20.8M."
    description: "It’s no secret that the PS5 has entered the “latter stage of its life cycle” with Sony resetting sales expectations in February. Today’s earnings report shows it just missing that revised 21M target by selling 20.8 million consoles for the fiscal year.  We’ll see if the rumored PS5 Pro helps change the trajectory before the year is done."

This downward trajectory doesn’t feel especially surprising to me. Sony have been openly telling people this console is on its way out; which is wild, considering it’s only been practical to get one in the past 18 months without scalping.

I have one – the hardware rocks! It certainly doesn't *feel* end of life to me.

You know what might help convince people to keep buying games consoles though? Investing in new games and IP, rather than doing the exact opposite of that and [laying off your development staff](https://www.polygon.com/24084509/playstation-layoff-900-workers-feb-2024).
