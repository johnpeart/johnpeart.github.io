I hoped this entry in *Marvel’s Spider-Man* series on PlayStation would be shorter than [the previous one](/game/1727343180/).

It was! At least, the main story was.

To churn out the Platinum trophy required a full replay of the entire story though. A cardinal sin I can't abide, and that puts a dampner on an otherwise *better* game than the first.
