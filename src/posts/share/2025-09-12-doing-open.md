        This is a resource for people who find themselves looking for examples and links about working in the open and agile communication.

I have just realised that Giles has published *yet another* great resource! First there was [Doing presentations](https://gilest.org/doingpresentations/), then [Doing weeknotes](https://gilest.org/doingweeknotes/), and now, [Doing open](https://gilest.org/doingopen/).

A welcome surprise too, is to see our own team's work being given the *Turnbull Seal of Approval*!

When Giles came in to do some [training on agile comms and working in the open](/2024/03/15/open-policy-meets-agile-comms/), he ran through an enormous Rolodex of best practice for this stuff.  I remember thinking “*I want our team in that Rolodex!*” and now we are.
