> **Warning:** Spoilers ahead!

This game requires wading through 10 to 15 hours of mediocre story and gameplay to get to about 5 hours of really bloody cool story and gameplay.

There are some things that are improved since *Jedi: Fallen Order*. Platforming is a bit less janky. There’s a fast-travel system now. You can unlock waypoints on your map for collectibles. You no longer have to complete 100% of every area of every map in order to get the platinum. You can  customise your lightsaber in a much more fun way (although, frustratingly, my dark side-inspired lightsaber didn't make the leap from the original to the sequel). 

There are some things that have stayed just as bad as before. Long loading times. Game-crashing bugs. Boring collect-all-the-things side quests.

Then there are choices that make the experience worse compared to original. You get 5 different fighting styles, but you can only switch between 2 of them at once. The fast-travel can only be used from a check-point; slowing down the point of fast-travel. Some of the levels are very large 'open world' formats that’s mostly desert and mostly boring, whilst others are comparatively tiny and very linear. That makes the game just a very uneven one to play.

And then there are those last 5 hours. 

*Warning*... *Spoilers coming up*... *You were warned*... 

You get to fight *Darth Vader*. Actual freaking *Darth “You were the Chosen One” Vader*. And it is *hard*. Punishingly difficult compared to the entirety of the rest of the game; and it’s not even the final boss (not even close in fact!). But so, so satisfying when you finally learn his move set and manage to conclude the battle.[^darth]

I spent most of this game waiting for it to conclude, and then by the time this happened, I didn't want it to end. 

It’s a shame there isn't some kind of boss-rush mode included in the game; because I'd happily fight *Darth Vader* over, and over, and over again... just for the fun of it!

[^darth]: I say 'conclude', because obviously he doesn't die. We know how he dies from the films.
