Just one thing I want to share this week: final preparations for our new digital service.

We're getting there. Slowly. Incrementally. It’s so close you can almost taste it.

Private beta will be released to some users on Monday.

In preparation for what’s coming, this week we've [updated some existing GOV.UK content](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/digital-identity) and we've published two new guidance pages:

A new “[collection page](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework)” that lists all current and previous versions of the UK digital identity and attributes trust framework. This new page will, we hope, make it easier to find these documents for stakeholders, rather than having to do Google-Fu.

And a new guidance page – “[Join the register of digital identity and attribute services](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/join-the-register-of-digital-identity-and-attribute-services)” – which should consolidate the patchy guidance we had on GOV.UK previously about our certification and registration process.

Meanwhile, the team has been furiously working to finish off the MVP of the service, so it can be opened up to the first batch of beta test users on Monday. Come back next week to find out if anything goes wrong!
