I visited some friends in Dublin this week with Matt. Feeling *touristy*, I popped into the Guinness Storehouse.

Two fun things I discovered on my trip:

1. You can get your face printed onto the top of a pint of a Guinness — something they call a “Stoutie”
2. Guinness 0.0 — the alcohol-free Guinness — tastes exactly the same as an alcohol-full pint of Ireland’s iconic stout
