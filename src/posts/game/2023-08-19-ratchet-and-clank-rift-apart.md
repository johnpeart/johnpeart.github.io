One of the very first games I ever played on the PlayStation 2 was *Ratchet & Clank*. I was one of those teenagers with a *Nintendo GameCube*, but on the odd occasion I was able to swap consoles with my sister, this franchise was one I loved to play. I've been coming back on every PlayStation generation since. 

It’s fitting, then, that my first ever Platinum trophy on PlayStation would be for the best instalment in the franchise yet: *Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart*.

It isn't a massive game; but it’s big enough. It isn't a difficult game; but it’s challenging enough.

It is a blockbuster though, with moments to delight, moments to make you laugh and, yes, moments to occasionally want to yeet your PlayStation controller out the window.
