I couldn't agree more with this sentiment: video games are getting *too damned big*.

I don't need hundreds of repetitive and frustrating side quests. Just give me the main storyline, make it thrilling, and don't make it so long that I lose interest.

[Cocoon](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP2333-PPSA08766_00-COCOONSIEE000000) was a recent, excellent example of this. It was only 6 hours long but every minute of it was brilliant, and ended just when it needed to.
