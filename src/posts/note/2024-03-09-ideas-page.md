Hot on the heels of discovering the ‘[Now](/note/1709629560/)’ page, I’ve also discovered the concept of an ‘Ideas’ page, thanks to the folks behind [About Ideas Now](//aboutideasnow.com). 

I like the way their [manifesto](https://aboutideasnow.com/about) describes the difference between an ‘About’, ‘Ideas’ and ‘Now’ page:

> **/about** pages are about the past: how people see themselves and what brought them there. That's useful as a general overview. 
> 
> **/now** is a more personal look at what people are doing right now, what they care about, and what they could use help with.
> 
> **/ideas** should be about the future: the crazy things people always wanted to make, concepts they're mulling over, or planned projects.

I've had an ‘[About](/about)’ page for *ages*[^about]; of course I did, it's personal site 101.

[^about]: My ‘[About](/about)’ page has mostly been a look at my career, voluntary and educational history. I think I might update it to be a bit less 'data driven' and a bit more personal, at some point.

I've recently added a ‘[Now](/now)’ page. 

And now I've *also* added an ‘[Ideas](/ideas)’ page.

I've cheated a little bit. I had a ‘Projects’ page on my site where I keep track of random bits of stuff I create. I've retired that page, and replaced it with the new ‘[Ideas](/ideas)’ page instead.
