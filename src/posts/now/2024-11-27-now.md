## It’s my birth-week

I turned 34 this week. I shall be referring to this as my "late-early thirties"; my "mid-thirties" can definitely wait until next year!

## Croydon plus the seaside

I'm still living in Croydon, but spending a lot of my time down in Brighton where my boyfriend – Matt – lives. His work means he’s based down there until at least next October, at which point we'll hopefully start living together.

## New job title, same job

I'm still in the UK Civil Service – 11.2 years now, according to the somewhat-alarming counter in the HR portal. I'm now working in the newly formed [Office for Digital Identities and Attributes](//gov.uk/ofdia), which is a part of the [Department for Science, Innovation and Technology](//www.gov.uk/dsit). 

I've acquired a new job title as part of moving into this newly formed unit; I'm now ‘Assistant Director for Market Oversight and Integrity’. The job itself hasn't changed from what it was with my old job title; I'm still delivering the operational parts of our team’s work; certification, governance and digital delivery. It’s increasingly complex, and I'm trying to not let it also become complicated.
