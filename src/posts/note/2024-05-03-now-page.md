I'm still on my adventures in the IndieWeb. Basically every day now I'm finding new ideas. The latest is the “Now” page.

Now pages are an idea by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/). They are pages that tell you “what this person is focused on at this point in their life.”[^now] 

Derek has even created [a directory of everyone's Now pages](//nownownow.com); which is a lovely way to get snapshots of other people's lives. I know none of these people: but I know a little something about all of them now.

[^now]: You can read more about the idea at [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about).

I like the idea, so I've set up my own at [www.johnpe.art/now](/now).
