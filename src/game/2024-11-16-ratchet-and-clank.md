This is a game based on a film based on a game that was originally released on the PlayStation 2.

It's a pretty faithful remake of the 2002 original, featuring familiar humour, gameplay and maps â€“ though the campaign is slightly truncated, omitting some of the planets that featured in the PS2 game.

Getting the Platinum trophy again requires a full replay of the game. In fact, I needed to play it two-and-a-half times, to gather a few of the other trophies that were linked to weapon upgrade paths and XP collection.

*But* I played this game when it came out, and half a dozen or so years later means that second replay was less frustrating than it otherwise could have been.
