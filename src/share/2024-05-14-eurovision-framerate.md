      Tonight’s Eurovision applied the “filmic” effect to the entire show output which reduced the effective motion frame rate to half the normal value, 25 frames per second which is near enough to the film standard of 24 fps.

When I was watching the semi-finals and grand final of this year’s Eurovision this week, I kept saying there was something weird going on with the frame rate.

I put it down to a bad BBC iPlayer stream, and it turns out I wasn’t imagining it. There was a weird frame rate.

I’m so used to seeing 60 or even 120 frames per second content now that it made the low frame rate presentation of this year’s Eurovision all the more jarring. 

I hope they revert back to normal next year.
