  - title: "Give something back"
    description: "Become a charity trustee or college governor by December 2020"
    max: 1.0
    progress: 0.1
    comment: "I didn't make good progress in my search for a role; nothing came up. So I'm trying again in 2021."
    
  - title: "Be a better friend"
    description: "Catch up with at least one friend a month"
    max: 12.0
    progress: 12.0
    comment: "I'm changing the definition of 'done' for this goal, because I've definitely seen a different set of friends (either in person or face-to-face) at least 12 times now. So instead, the goal is to do something sociable at least once a month, instead of being once a month on average. I'm succeeding so far at the new, more stretching goal too."
  
  - title: "Keep writing"
    description: "Publish at least one blog post every month"
    max: 12.0
    progress: 11.0
    comment: "I will have published 11 blog posts this year."
    
  - title: "Start a podcast"
    description: "Finish creating a podcast and publish at least 5 episodes"
    max: 5.0
    stretch: 5.0
    progress: 5.5
    comment: "I have achieved this goal by accident. I started the year planning to launch 'the Department of Bad Ideas', but an opportunity came along to create a podcast for Pride so I've done that too. I've released 5 episodes of the 'PrideON podcast' now and recorded a further 2 episodes of 'the Department of Bad Ideas'. So my new stretch goal is to release 10 episodes overall across both podcasts."
  
  - title: "Be healthier"
    description: "Lose 10kg through better diet and exercise"
    max: 10.0
    stretch: 5.0
    progress: 10.0
    comment: "On my final weighing day for the year before Christmas feasting (21 December), I weighed exactly 70kg; meaning I've lost 10kg since 1 January 2020."
    
  - title: "Dry January"
    description: "No alcohol for 31 days, starting 1 January 2020"
    max: 31.0
    progress: 30.0
    comment: "I made it to the 31 January, and then needed a drink."
  
  - title: "Save some money"
    description: "Save Â£5,000 by 31 December 2020"
    max: 5000.00
    stretch: 2500.00

    max: 1.0
    progress: 0.6
    comment: "If there was ever going to be a 'moment' to do this, 2020 is probably it! I bought a bike and learnt the basics, but I'm not a confident cyclist, so this is only partially done."
