      Accessibility is easier when you do it earlier, I can't emphasise that enough.

One of the things I think our digital service team is doing well at the moment is getting ahead of accessibility issues before they happen.

The whole team has been swotting up on WCAG 2.2. Every planning meeting, and every design crit were asking ourselves “is that going to be accessible?” before we start typing code. 

We’re using the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk) we have access to fully-worked up, tested code, which is leading to fewer mistakes.

We’ve been iteratively auditing parts of our service (and not waiting until the end, as some had advised we should!).

And, of course, we’ve been testing with users who have a range of disabilities.

Are there still bits that need tweaking? Yes. But as Hidde indicates, things have been orders of magnitude easier to fix because we’re thinking about accessibility from the start.
