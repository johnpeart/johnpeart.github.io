Since 2017, I've been keeping track of the number of LGBT+ MPs that have a seat in the UK Parliament. 

[I started doing this to help me at work](/2020/02/24/making-a-dataset-of-lgbt-mps/) but since then this dataset has been used by news outlets like the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40232272) and [Sky News](https://news.sky.com/story/general-election-2019-heralds-the-most-diverse-parliament-for-gender-and-ethnicity-11885529), by academics at institutions like the [London School of Economics](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/lgb-representation/), and by governmental organisations like the [Equality and Human Rights Commission](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/publication-download/diversity-candidates-and-elected-officials-great-britain) and [United Nations Development Programme](https://www.undp.org/publications/building-inclusive-democracies-guide-strengthening-participation-lgbti-persons-political-and-electoral-processes). Open data, for the win!

On 4 July 2024, the UK went to the polls for its most recent General Election. On 5 July, the results started rolling in and new MPs were returned to the House of Commons. 

This is what we know about the composition of Parliament today:

## More than 10% of MPs are LGBT+

Of the 650 MPs returned, 67 of them are openly lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans, or have another minority sexual orientation or gender identity (LGBT+). (Though I should note that, whilst we have had a trans MP in the past, there appear to be no trans or non-binary MPs in this Parliament).

By “openly LGBT+”, I mean that there is a trustworthy publicly available source to verify that they are definitely LGBT+. This might be a public statement from the person, or an interview they've done, or other reporting from a reputable journalistic or academic source. [The dataset includes the sources](//www.lgbt.mp), so you can look at them yourself.

At more than 10% of MPs, there are more than 3 times more LGBT+ people in the Commons than you would expect based on the demographics of the national population.[^census]

[^census]: The UK's most recent, 2021 Census found that 3.2% of the UK's population identified as having a sexual orientation other than heterosexual, and 0.5% that identify as trans.

## Most LGBT+ MPs are from the Labour Party

Of the 411 MPs elected for the Labour Party at this election, 53 of them are LGBT+. That's more than 12% of the Parliamentary Labour Party and more than double the number of LGBT+ MPs Labour had at the start of the previous Parliament.

Of the remaining 239 MPs elected in other parties:

- 7 Liberal Democrat MPs are LGBT+
- 5 Conservative MPs are LGBT+
- 1 Green MP is LGBT+
- 1 SNP MP is LGBT+

## The most LGBT+ MPs ever

Whilst initially it appeared there had been a slight reduction in the number of MPs elected to Parliament this time around had decreased; the number has actually gone up!

Over the past few weeks, half a dozen or so volunteers — people I don’t know but have popped up on GitHub — have offered up public sources to evidence that there are even more MPs who are LGBT+.

The dataset is now up to date reflecting that. (And if you know of any we’ve missed, please do let me know!)
