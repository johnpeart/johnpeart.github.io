When I was a kid, I was obsessed with two things: video games and *LEGO*. Whilst other kids were off riding bikes, playing football or creating chaos, I could usually be found elbow deep in a supersized bucket of bricks.

I still play a lot of [video games](/games) today, but *LEGO*? Not so much.

## An unexpected gift

Somewhat out of the blue, my sister got me this [*LEGO Ideas Polaroid OneStep SX-70 Camera*] set for Christmas; which was very generous of her.

I was giddy with excitement to tear open that box and put it together but, having gone home to visit family at Christmas, had to resist the urge.

A few weeks ago, though, I had a quiet night sat in my living room. That was my chance to get lost in the experience and rediscover my childhood glee of building something from teeny-tiny pieces of plastic.

## A sense of accomplishment 

As I sat unpacking the bags of bricks, carefully setting them out and reading the instruction manual, my immediate thought was "how many pieces?!".

This was not going to be a build for the light hearted one that I could rush. I was in this for the long-haul.

It took me more than *three hours* to put the thing together. I was a bit exhausted by the end of it, to be honest!

But when it was done? I was chuffed!

Look at this thing.

It is so cool! 

And it actually *works*. Not to take photos – though that might be a fun 'hack' to build some electronics into it – but it does *function*. That big red button on the front forces a faux *Polaroid* picture to mechanically pop out from the front of the faux camera.

The whole thing is just delightful. It's sat on my shelf in my study now, and every time I see it or pop the big red button, it brings a little smile to my face.
