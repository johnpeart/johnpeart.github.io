        Inspired by the incredible Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, this episode of The PlayStation Access Podcast see the gang chatting all things remakes:  their favourites, what makes a great remake, and what games they'd love to see get the remake treatment.

The *PlayStation Access* podcast has me completely stumped, thinking about which games *haven't* been remade, but I would want them to be.

Loads of my favourite old games have *already been* remade.

- *Tomb Raider* has been remade – with the Anniversary Edition – *and* remastered with updated graphics, last year
- *Command & Conquer* and its sequel, *Red Alert*, have been remastered – though I'd love to see *Tiberian Sun* and *Red Alert 2* given the same treatment
- *The Legend of Zelda: Windwaker* was given the “HD” treatment on the *Nintendo Wii U*, although it would be nice to see it re-released on the *Switch*
- I'm not entirely sure if this counts but loads of *Mario* and *Luigi* games have been ported and rereleased on newer generations of console, bringing them from *GameCube*, *Wii* and *Wii U* to the *Switch* and now *Switch 2*; the most obvious of which is *Mario Kart 8*
- The *Batman: Arkham* series was remastered for PS4 and still looks great
- *Bioshock* go a facelift as part of the “Complete Edition”, updating it from PS3 to PS4
- *Broken Sword* has been lovingly and beautifully redrawn, frame for frame, in the recent remasters
- Even some of my more niche loves, like *Theme Hospital*, have *kind of* been remade with spiritual successors like *Two Point Hospital*

It's *really* hard to think of classic games that I loved that still are yearning for a remake or remaster.
