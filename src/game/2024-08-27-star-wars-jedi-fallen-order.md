Now that I've gotten my first clutch of Platinum trophies on PlayStation, I had had an itch to go back to some other games and finish off ones that I "completed" but didn't "100%". 

*STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order* is one of those games. I loved this game when it first came out. It was an absolute romp. Who wouldn't want to feel like an absolute boss wielding a lightsaber and *the force* in a completely new *STAR WARS* story?! 

But, in truth, I absolutely *sucked* at it.

Replaying it to collect the final trophies I was missing, I realised *why* I sucked at it. I never understood the Soulslike genre on which it was based. 

But now I'm an Elden Lord. *Now*, I understand the game; and now I've been able to blast through it like a Jedi should to grab that Platinum.
