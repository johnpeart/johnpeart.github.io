Today I've stumbled upon [Lynn Fisher's website](//lynnandtonic.com). It is **awesome**.

The graphics and illustrations. The colour scheme. That gorgeous, elongated typography that's fully responsive to the window size. *Chef's kiss*.

I love finding websites like this and the people behind them. Incredibly beautiful websites created by wonderfully talented people. There's so much to learn from looking at, tinkering with and building upon other people's code.

It's not just Lynn's core website that's superb either; look at this enormous array of [work and projects](https://lynnandtonic.com/work/) she has going on too.

Apparently Lynn refreshes the design from top to bottom annually; [here are all the archived designs](https://lynnandtonic.com/archive/). I'd encourage you to [look at this one](https://lynnandtonic.com/archive/2021/). Do it on a desktop, and try resizing the window. Mind-bending. 

I can't wait to see what Lynn cooks up next so I can learn from it!
