This is *Elden Ring*. And it is not *Elden Ring*.

The landscapes, controls, weapons and enemies are all familiar, but the gameplay loop is entirely new (or, at least, new for a FromSoft game). The open world role-playing game elements are swapped out for a 45-minute, multiplayer looping rogue-like format.

The Platinum trophy for this game was fairly straightforward; mostly involving beating all the bosses in different combinations. 

I can’t say I’ve had the same sense of awe and wonder with this game as I did with the original, but I certainly have the same sense of challenge. Not because the game is inherently difficult (though it is pretty tough) but because *Nightreign’s* mechanics are *limited*.

You can only level up so much; so slightly over-levelling to push past a frustrating boss is not an option.

When you die to a boss, you have to restart the whole, 45-minute round again; so learning a moveset of a boss is much more tedious.

Every weapon and upgrade is down to the Random Number Generator in game; and all the good stuff – or at least, any of the stuff I like to use – is desperately rare.

The mechanics might be limited but the gameplay is fun. Every run is a deeply chaotic. The new two-player option is great too.

My most major criticism is its depth. You run out of unique things to do pretty quickly. It’s a paid-for-upfront game that is screaming out for live-service treatment. There will be a DLC coming before the end of the year, and I hope that breathes some additional life into it before people get bored of it and stop playing!
