This game is not as bad as the critical reviews would have you believe. 

Yes, when making a direct comparison to the Batman *Arkham* games that *RockSteady Studios* previously created, it is weak. The gameplay can be repetitive and unimaginative. The world is sparse. The live service elements are completely pointless and largely ignorable. 

So why have I spent upwards of 28 hours playing this decidedly mediocre game? The characters and the story.

*Suicide Squad* may be painfully cookie cutter in most respects but not when it comes to story telling. The story is a proper comic book romp. The premise is daft and whimsical. The writing is pretty funny; I had actual laugh out loud moments at King Shark.

Would I have been absolutely smoked if I had paid the full £70 RRP for this game? Yes, absolutely. But as a pack in with the PlayStation Plus subscription this month – making the cost of the game effectively less than a fiver – it’s alright, you know!

Not every game needs to be amazing. The core game mechanics in *Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League* are no more of less exciting than most looter-shooters. Sometimes you just want to blow things up and have a laugh whilst you're at it.
