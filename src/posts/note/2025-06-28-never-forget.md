Today, 28 June marks the anniversary of the Stonewall uprising and the birth of the pride movement.

Never forget, it was lesbian and gay men and women, and gender non-conforming men and women, and trans men and women — many of them people of colour — that were the first to stand up and push back.

Never forget.

Marsha P. Johnson.

Sylvia Rivera.

Stormé DeLarverie.

Craig Rodwell.

Bob Kohler.

The many others who were there but were doing know their names and their courage.

All of them. All of *us*. All together.

United we protect our rights and freedoms. Divided, we all lose.
