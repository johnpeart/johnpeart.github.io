*Super Mario Land 3: Wario Land* is one of the earliest games I ever remember playing. 

I've recently replayed the game using my newly purchased [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket) and, some twenty-odd years later, it still holds up! 

On this latest play-through I've achieved what was previously impossible for 10-ish year old me: 100% completion. All the collectibles and 6 full bags of coins.
