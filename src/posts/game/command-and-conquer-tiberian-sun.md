The real-time strategy (RTS) genre may be commercially dead in 2025, but in the early 2000s it was alive and kicking. The *Command & Conquer* series was the epitome of the genre.

Corny and stupid. Puzzling and challenging. Camp and chaotic. All the classic *C&C* games are the same. 

*Tiberian Sun* was the first one I properly played and – now that I'm replaying it – I remember why I loved it so much. Far more than a decade later, it still holds up!
