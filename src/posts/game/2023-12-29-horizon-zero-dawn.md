I completed *Horizon Zero Dawn's* story several years ago, but I recently returned to it to play it through again and to try to get that sacred Platinum trophy.

I regret my decision.

The story is exceptional. I think it's brilliantly told, with some top class acting talent to sell it – especially *Lance Reddick's* performance as *Sylens*. 

But Horizon Zero Dawn is an open world game and, as I have discovered, getting a Platinum trophy in an open world game is rarely worth the reward. You spend *so long* traipsing around doing busy work that you lose the fun and wonder of the game.

I've recently started playing the sequel (which even for me – an avid science fiction lover – has a story that is a bit far-fetched) and I don't even know if I'll have the desire to finish it.

Open world games should be big enough to finish within 10 to 20 hours. [That size game is *juuusssttt* right](/share/1703800288/).
