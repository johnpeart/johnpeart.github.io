You wait 10 years to see one of your all-time favourite artists on tour; and then you get the chance to see her at least 3 times in 6 months!

I saw Loreen at the *Hammersmith Apollo* on 19 March 2025. I'll be seeing her twice more later this year, as she seemingly tours every festival and pride event in the UK over the summer.  

I rocked up a the *Apollo* fully hoping to have a transcendent experience induced through bone-rattling bass. 

Alas, my bones were not rattled but the set list was filled with some of Loreen’s best tracks. There was a lot of her more recent music and surprisingly little of her 2013 album *Heal*, which I still think was her best.

The whole gig was brutally efficient. Loreen barely took a breath between each of the 13 tracks she performed. She just bashed them out, one after the other, mostly without skipping a beat. And then, she was done.

That was a bizarre choice. People go to gigs to interact with the musician; and there wasn't really any of that. A couple of brief interactions before she sang her winning songs from Eurovision – *Euphoria* and *Tattoo* – but otherwise, *zilch*, *zip*, *na da*.
