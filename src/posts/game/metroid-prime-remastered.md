When this game was originally released on the *Nintendo GameCube* way back in 2002, I was... well, I was about as good at this as you would expect a 12 year old to be. 

To be fair to tween-age me, being bad at it wasn't entirely my fault. The game notoriously had difficult to use controls; the gaming industry still hadn't figured out the twin-stick, first-person mechanics familiar to pretty much every game sold today.

But, being bad at it, I was mortified. This was a super cool, spacey-wacey puzzle and combat game. I wanted to be good at it and I wanted to love it.

So I persevered for a little bit longer. A *very* little bit, because I then encountered my first “war wasp” and hard noped out. (I *hate* wasps at the best of times and these ones were the size of a baby and flying at me aggressively). 

So there ended my *Metroid Prime* excursion; at the time, anyway. Luckily, 35 year old me is marginally more tolerant of wasps and exceedingly more capable at video games. 

With *Metroid Prime 4: Beyond* coming out in just a few days time, I have a brilliant excuse to revisit this game and try again. 

It is a masterpiece. 

It's atmospheric. The music is brilliant. The environmental story telling – where you mostly learn about this strange new world through scanning objects in the world – is intriguing. 

It's challenging.  The enemies are varied and interesting. The puzzles are fun. Whilst you go backtracking through the game a lot (by design) every area feels new every time you revisit a room; and just a little bit scary that a new, stronger enemy might have appeared.

I can't believe I didn't play this more when I was a lot younger. It's brilliant.
