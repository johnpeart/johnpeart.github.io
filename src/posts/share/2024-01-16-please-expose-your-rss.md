This post has prompted me to update my own RSS feeds. It's been a long time since I've given them an overhaul.

I've recently been adding new post formats to the site: replies and comments, boosts and sharing, quick notes and lists. My RSS feed, though? Just plain old blog posts.

Not any more. You can now subscribe to more than a dozen feeds from my site with lots of different post formats. All of them are available on the [feeds](/feeds) page, and RSS readers should auto-detect all of them too.

If you've got a website, do as Robb suggests: expose your RSS!
