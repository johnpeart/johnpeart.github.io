      Soon, though, WhatsApp will do the previously unthinkable for its 2 billion users: allow people to message you from another app.

Fascinating to see how the EU Digital Markets Act is starting to have real world impact on the products we use each day. 

The mental overhead of juggling between messaging apps is brain space that I could do with getting back. I can't wait to move all my messaging into one app. Oh, the glorious simplicity! That is, if they manage to execute, and if all my *other* messaging apps *also* choose to interoperate.
