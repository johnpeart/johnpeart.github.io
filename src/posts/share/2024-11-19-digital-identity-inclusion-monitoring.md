      This week my team has published a report on the results of an inclusion monitoring survey. This survey is mandatory for digital identity providers who are [certified against the trust framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-certified-digital-identity-and-attribute-services). You can [read the full report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-identity-services-inclusion-monitoring-report-findings) on GOV.UK.

We think inclusion is imperative. Everyone who chooses to use a digital identity should be able to do so.

That's why we're monitoring how accessible and inclusive the digital identity and attribute services certified against the government's trust framework are.
