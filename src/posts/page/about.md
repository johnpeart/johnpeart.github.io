Hello. 

I'm John Peart. 

I'm originally from Devon, but grew up in North Lincolnshire and Somerset. I live in London now, having moved here for university.

I'm a policy person working in the UK Civil Service. I design, develop and deliver programmes of work to meet the objectives of the incumbent government. All of my roles have focused on either digital or equalities policy and delivery.

I currently work for the [Office for Digital Identities and Attributes](//www.gov.uk/ofdia), a part of the [Department for Science, Innovation and Technology](//www.gov.uk/dsit). We're making it possible to trust digital identity products and services, so you can use them across the UK economy.
