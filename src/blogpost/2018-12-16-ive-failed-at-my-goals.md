On 1 January 2018, I set myself five goals for the year. They were that I would:

1. write and publish a blog post every week
2. publish a set of photos I had taken every month
3. save £5,000 by 31 December 2018
4. go for a run twice a week
5. visit a great place to eat every month

I usually suck at sticking to my New Year's Resolutions, so this year I tried to do things differently.

The first thing I did was make them public to make myself accountable. I made [a dashboard](/goals/2018/) so my progress was visible.

Instead of setting big and amorphous goals, I set goals that were specific and easily measurable. My thinking was that the more regularly I was able to tell myself I was making progress, the more motivated I would be to do them.

I built in some redundancy too. Instead of making one big goal to achieve for the year, I created five goals to ensure that I had a reason to keep at it if something went wrong. I also said that I only needed to do 80% of each goal to claim "success".

## How did I do?

It is 16 December 2018, and as I write this, **I have achieved a grand total of one goal** by my own definition of success; I have been to 10 places that I consider "a great place to eat" this year; more than 80% of the target. Huzzah!

Unfortunately that means I failed to achieve four out of the five goals I set out to achieve this year. It's not all doom though.

### Write a blog post every week

Whilst I didn't manage write 52 blog posts this year, I have written more posts this year than I have in any single year since I started blogging.

My previous record in one year was 13 blog posts. This year, including this post, I've written 16 posts, and I've still a few more to publish this year. I missed the target by some margin, but I still did more than I ever have before.

In hindsight, setting a goal to write four-times more posts this year than I have ever managed in the same period previously was a bit unreasonable in the first place.

### Publish some photos every month

I didn't manage to publish 12 photosets this year either; I published five. Again, though, that's more photosets than I published last year (last year I published 2).

### Save £5,000 this year

I have saved a whole bunch of money this year, and then subsequently spent it. Between two holidays and a bunch of new tech, I spent *a lot* of money that I could have easily saved. Despite all this though, I have saved about £900, and I've had a good time with the money I spent. I don't feel too bad about this one really; as I always tell myself, *you can't take your money with you when you're dead*.

### Run more

I have many, many excuses for why this didn't get off the ground.

I don't like running in the rain. I don't like running in snow. I injured my foot in April that made it painful to walk, let alone run. Then a knee injury flared up.

Ultimately, these are all excuses. I could have done a range of other exercises to offset these, or maybe even joined a gym, but the reality is that I'm just too lazy. So it didn't get done.

## Lessons learnt for 2019

I'm going to set myself goals for 2019, because whilst under my definition of success I failed 80% of the time, I feel like I've actually made fairly decent progress. Certainly, I have done more than I would have done had I not set these goals in the first place. I feel like my "in the open", "built-in redundancy", "specific and measurable" goals formula worked fairly well too, but it could do with some tweaking.

For 2019, I'm going to make sure my goals are SMART[^1], not just specific. Thinking I could -- for example -- quadruple my blogging output was ridiculous, and I should have been more realistic. I'm also going to set a greater diversity of goals to drive me to do more things I have been meaning to do for ages.

One thing I won't be changing is putting my goals in the open but, do me a favour? If you're reading this, it would be helpful if someone -- like, literally anyone -- would nag me about getting on with the things I end up saying I'm going to do.
