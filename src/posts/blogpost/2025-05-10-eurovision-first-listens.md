- country: "Albania"
  shortcode: "ALB"
  emoji: "🇦🇱"
  artist: "Shkodra Elektronike"
  song: 
    original: "Zjerm"
    english: "Fire"
  language: "Albanian"
  youtube: "Sfvb761EEcM"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  lyric: |
    Freedom of speech is something school should teach you.
  commentary: |
    The plucking of a stringed instrument provides a peppy introduction to this song. It reminds me of something you might hear in a *Legend of Zelda* soundtrack. 
    
    Alas, that chipper tone doesn’t hang around. Instead we leap into a terrible spoken word chunk in the middle, dinging an otherwise fine track.
    
- country: "Armenia"
  shortcode: "ARM"
  emoji: "🇦🇲"
  artist: "Parg"
  song: "Survivor"
  language: "English"
  youtube: "RfH5o3XtI2c"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  lyric: |
    I’m a survivor. I’m staying alive-ah.
  commentary: |
    So Armenia are bringing us a hard rock vibe this year. There’s heavily-distorted electric guitars, some spittingly-speedy lyrics and exceedingly questionable rhyming schemes. 
    
    (“Survivor” does not rhyme with “Staying alive”, no matter how much you elongate the last syllable, guys). 
    
- country: "Australia"
  shortcode: "AUS"
  emoji: "🇦🇺"
  artist: "Go-Jo"
  song: "Milkshake Man"
  language: "English, French"
  youtube: "_08I6mjHSLA"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  lyric: |
    I can tell you want a taste of the Milkshake Man!
  commentary: |
    This song starts with the familiar progression from "Green Sleeves" on a xylophone. From such innocent beginnings is spawned a song overflowing with absolute filth.
    
    This song is choc-full of cheap sugar.
    
    *Go-Jo* knows exactly what he’s doing and, no, I absolutely will not be calling him "*the Milkshake Man*".
    
- country: "Austria"
  shortcode: "AUT"
  emoji: "🇦🇹"
  artist: "JJ"
  song: "Wasted Love"
  language: "English"
  youtube: "-ieSTNpxvio"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  lyric: |
    Now that you're gone all I have is wasted love.
  commentary: |
    There are a lot of tortured water-based metaphors in the beginning of this song, which initially had me thinking this would be utter dross. 
    
    What I wasn’t expecting was a quick tilt from mediocre ballad into operatic style. Maybe I should have; Austria is famous for its opera. 
    
    But the surprises didn’t stop there; I was *also* not expecting the mid-song drum and bass drop.
    
    Clearly inspired by last year’s Swiss entry and absolutely mad.
    
- country: "Azerbaijan"
  shortcode: "AZE"
  emoji: "🇦🇿"
  artist: "Mamagama"
  song: "Run with U"
  language: "English"
  youtube: "upbiPJ9uA70"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  lyric: |
    No matter what you do tonight, I wanna run with you.
  commentary: |
    *Mamagama* was clearly using a T9 keyboard on an old Nokia when he wrote the title for this song.
    
    Aside from the poor spelling, this is an enjoyable fusion of modern beats and what I assume are authentic Azerbaijani instruments, twanging away atop.
    
- country: "Belgium"
  shortcode: "BEL"
  emoji: "🇧🇪"
  artist: "Red Sebastian"
  song: "Strobe Lights"
  language: "English"
  youtube: "ScupiVTosHU"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  lyric: |
    Cotton candy haze, we're floatin' 'round in space.
  commentary: |
    This is a song of high-drama, clubland mist and colossally clichéd lyrics. 
    
    It ups the ante and energy as it goes on; which I appreciate.
    
    There’s an impressive falsetto towards the finish; but as ever, the live vocal will be what counts. Will it sound as good on the night?
    
- country: "Croatia"
  shortcode: "HRV"
  emoji: "🇭🇷"
  artist: "Marko Bošnjak"
  song: "Poison Cake"
  language: "English"
  youtube: "ie_v6qGCc5w"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  lyric: |
    Tasty, tasty, yum, yum, tasty.
  commentary: |
    This is the latest in a long line of food-related Eurovision songs. Classics of the genre include 2014's Belarussian and Latvian entries, *Cheesecake* and *Cake to Bake*, and the 2021 Moldovan entry, *Sugar*.
    
    It’s hard to not see the connection to last year's Irish entry, though this is much more erratic. The delirious musical style ranges from death-metal, to spoken word, to sugar-pop.
    
    *Nigella* would never.
    
- country: "Cyprus"
  shortcode: "CYP"
  emoji: "🇨🇾"
  artist: "Theo Evan"
  song: "Shh"
  language: "English"
  youtube: "rbfQqWyqgJw"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  lyric: |
    I’ve been told I am a little over confident and this will be my downfall.
  commentary: |
    We are off to clubland with this interminable track that’s filled with more clichés than a drag brunch bingo event.
    
    The choruses are fine, I guess, but the whole thing is delivered without any real charisma. For an attempt at a gay club banger, it needs a lot more sex and fervour.
    
- country: "Czechia"
  shortcode: "CZE"
  emoji: "🇨🇿"
  artist: "Adonxs"
  song: "Kiss Kiss Goodbye"
  language: "English"
  youtube: "Hm8CIICKAJU"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  lyric: |
    Blow me a kiss goodbye, see how my tears run dry.
  commentary: |
    There’s a rich tone to the vocals in this song and it’s a decent, mid-tempo, moody ballad.
    
    The middle eight doesn’t fit at all with the rest of the song. Ramming a dance track breakdown into a ballad is a cheap trick to breathe life to a corpse and in this case, it wasn’t necessary.
    
- country: "Denmark"
  shortcode: "DNK"
  emoji: "🇩🇰"
  artist: "Sissal"
  song: "Hallucination"
  language: "English"
  youtube: "gdCAgiSIOUc"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  lyric: |
    You're my hallu—, hallucination.
  commentary: |
    Now *this* is why I come for Eurovision!
    
    Denmark is serving up supreme Scandipop. A good beat, slick production and a cracking vocal.
    
    I was hooked from the first few seconds.
    
    The catchy falsetto riff in the chorus is a sublime earworm. The orchestration reminds me a little of *Euphoria*.
    
    *Douze points* from me.
    
- country: "Estonia"
  shortcode: "EST"
  emoji: "🇪🇪"
  artist: "Tommy Cash"
  song: "Espresso Macchiato"
  language: "Italian, English"
  youtube: "5MS_Fczs_98"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  lyric: |
    No stresso, no stresso. It's gonna be espresso.
  commentary: |
    I had assumed this would be a stylish response to Sabrina Carpenter. You know, like when Miley did *Flowers* as a massive [“fuck you” to her ex-husband](https://www.smoothradio.com/artists/bruno-mars/miley-cyrus-flowers-lyrics-meaning/) by interpolating Bruno Mars’ *When I Was Your Man*.
    
    Instead, we get a cheap, nonsense song with almost no redeeming features.
    
    *Next!*
    
- country: "Finland"
  shortcode: "FIN"
  emoji: "🇫🇮"
  artist: "Erika Vikman"
  song: 
    original: "Ich komme"
    english: "I’m coming"
  language: "Finnish"
  youtube: "Kg3QoTpnqyw"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  lyric: |
    I'll dance with you even a wedding waltz, but naked
  commentary: |
    I guess we're still trying to replicate *Cha Cha Cha* then.
    
    This has a ridiculous vibe. Like something out of an 80's musical B-movie.
    
    Erika hasn't shied away from the sexual innuendo.  The lyrics are pure filth; they've got spunk -- literally.
    
- country: "France"
  shortcode: "FRA"
  emoji: "🇫🇷"
  artist: "Louane"
  song: 
    original: "Mamon"
    english: "Mum"
  language: "French"
  youtube: "ZFWzMZh47d0"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  lyric: |
    There are no more one night stands, there are no more beds.
  commentary: |
    I have a habit of dismissing the French *chanson* style and that is unfair. It’s a beautiful style and I’m learning to like it. Listening back to old Eurovision albums gives me an increasing appreciation of the style.
    
    I don’t know if this is strictly within the *chanson* genre but, nonetheless, there’s a woman singing dramatically.
    
    And then a random child at the end.
    
- country: "Georgia"
  shortcode: "GEO"
  emoji: "🇬🇪"
  artist: "Mariam Shengelia"
  song: "Freedom"
  language: "Georgian, English"
  youtube: "c3wu0dUNd4c"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  lyric: |
    I'm livin' my life with my smile.
  commentary: |
    Some terrifyingly deep vocals lurk underneath this somewhat bonkers song. I feel like witness to a dark arts ritual at which there will be a sacrifice.
    
    The gear shifts between the verses and chorus are pretty jarring, and rip you out of the moment a bit.
    
- country: "Germany"
  shortcode: "DEU"
  emoji: "🇩🇪"
  artist: "Abor & Tynna"
  song: 
    original: "Baller"
    english: "Shoot"
  language: "German"
  youtube: "zJplC4-9Scs"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  lyric: |
    And then I'll change perfumes and buy myself a new outfit.
  commentary: |
    We’ve got high-pitched synths and nonsense lyrics in this trance track.
    
    The styling of the vocals -- stuttering and sputtering -- is fun and unique.
    
    I like it.
    
- country: "Greece"
  shortcode: "GRC"
  emoji: "🇬🇷"
  artist: "Klavdia"
  song: 
    original: "Asteromáta"
    english: "Star Eyes"
  language: "Greek"
  youtube: "aDiq8J9h6vQ"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  lyric: |
    Turn so I can kiss you so I can extinguish my lips in your holy tears.
  commentary: |
    I like the sound of the titular word “Asteromáta” -- it’s fun to say and to listen to.
    
    The first 1:30 of this song are dreary and uninspiring. There's some more texture in the second half; more synth, more percussion, more drama and more power in the vocal.
    
    But it never quite goes anywhere. I certainly don't feel like I'm transcending to the stars.
    
- country: "Iceland"
  shortcode: "ISL"

  artist: "Væb"
  song: 
    original: "Róa"
    english: "Calm"
  language: "Icelandic"
  youtube: "s9P83Nl6D1M"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  lyric: |
    I place a plank on a plank, and call it a boat.
  commentary: |
    Well, there's certainly nothing calm about this.
    
    Another predominantly spoken word and rap number, with clear inspiration from *Windows95Man*, of last year’s Contest.
    
    Dire.
    
- country: "Ireland"
  shortcode: "IRL"
  emoji: "🇮🇪"
  artist: "EMMY"
  song: "Laika Party"
  language: "English"
  youtube: "cZnusVb7yjs"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  lyric: |
    I hope Laika never died and that she spins around us still
  commentary: |
    This threw me straight back to *The Logical Song* ([the cover by Scooter](4YxTa1AUqps), not [the original by Supertramp](kln_bIndDJg?si=4TQ79lgPqT-IQbAF))
    
    This is generic, dance floor-filling trash and I love it.
    
- country: "Israel"
  shortcode: "ISR"
  emoji: "🇮🇱"
  artist: "Yuval Raphael"
  song: "New Day Will Rise"
  language: "English, French, Hebrew"
  youtube: "Q3BELu4z6-U"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  lyric: |
    Everyone cries, don't cry alone.
  commentary: |
    I miss the days of Israel being fun at Eurovision. They days of *[Toy](CziHrYYSyPc?si=sUKEwmsK2ucTaJTy)* and *[Golden Boy](NdxOCTezeTg?si=CvAQCr9Rj4Ph9e9w)*.
    
    Nevertheless, this is a ballad in three separate languages -- English, French and Hebrew -- which is an impressive twist.
    
    There are flashes of *Celine Dion* in this track as it crescendos towards its conclusion. 
    
- country: "Italy"
  shortcode: "ITA"
  emoji: "🇮🇹"
  artist: "Lucio Corsi"
  song: 
    original: "Volevo essere un duro"
    english: "I wanted to be a tough guy"
  language: "Italian"
  youtube: "-Alz9MnqyZI"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  lyric: |
    I wanted to be a tough guy, but I'm nobody.
  commentary: |
    Another year, another Italian man singing a dreary song with a sloppy rhythm and the occasional shouty lyric.
    
    The lyrics, if you look them up, are marginally disturbed.
    
    Anyway, *meh*. [Just give us more opera!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TOMqZV2jA8)

  song: 
    original: "Bur man laimi"
    english: "Give me luck"
  language: "Latvian"
  youtube: "RKw0OCgPV3s"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  lyric: |
    Curses and hexes, never can they ruin me.
  commentary: |
    This is a classic of the “bunch of women screaming nonsensically atop a heavily over-orchestrated backing track” genre: a Eurovision staple but hardly worth the three minutes.
    
- country: "Lithuania"
  shortcode: "LTU"
  emoji: "🇱🇹"
  artist: "Katarsis"
  song: 
    original: "Tavo akys"
    english: "Your eyes"
  language: "Lithuanian"
  youtube: "R2f2aZ6Fy58"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  lyric: |
    The foundations of everything have already begun to rot.
  commentary: |
    A miserable, droning verse crashes into an angsty chorus in this “experimental rock” track.
    
    The vocalist sounds like he'd rather be having a root-canal than singing this song.
    
- country: "Luxembourg"
  shortcode: "LUX"
  emoji: "🇱🇺"
  artist: "Laura Thorn"
  song: 
    original: "La poupeé monte le son"
    english: "The doll turns up the sound"
  language: "French"
  youtube: "LVHu_KwHiKY"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  lyric: |
    I make my voice heard to trigger in you the electric shock.
  commentary: |
    There’s a forceful momentum to this song that’s quite fun.
    
    It’s *different* from almost everything else. Perhaps a bit cheesy, though the lyrics are somewhat more serious than the puppet metaphor would imply.
    
- country: "Malta"
  shortcode: "MLT"
  emoji: "🇲🇹"
  artist: "Miriana Conte"
  song: "Serving"
  language: "English"
  youtube: "sLVSwfRRvMA"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  lyric: |
    Serving (Ah)
  commentary: |
    I am aware of the controversy surrounding this track and that it was originally titled *Kant* (it's the Maltese word for "singing"), and that "ah" wasn't the word that appeared after "serving" in the chorus. It was this year’s [“veggie and pussy” moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbDj9mBI4g0). 
    
    Clearly that was a publicity stunt but it almost wasn’t necessary. This is a sassy banger.
    
    Three minutes of high-energy, four to the floor drums and confident vocals.
    
- country: "Montenegro"
  shortcode: "MNE"
  emoji: "🇲🇪"
  artist: "Nina Žižić"
  song: 
    original: "Dobrodošli"
    english: "Welcome"
  language: "Montenegrin"
  youtube: "ydMkpaB0CWk"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  lyric: |
    Put a smile on your face, endure it all, it'll pass.
  commentary: |
    For a song entitled *Welcome* this song isn't half... well... *unwelcoming*. 
    
    It’s incredibly dramatic. It’s almost like a Bond-theme, with an undulating melody that rocks up-and-down the scales on the keys.
    
- country: "Netherlands"
  shortcode: "NLD"
  emoji: "🇳🇱"
  artist: "Claude"
  song: 
    original: "C'est la vie"
    english: "That's life"
  language: "French, English"
  youtube: "hEHwr5k9pd0"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  lyric: |
    It's like this, it's like that, it goes up, it goes down, and around and around.
  commentary: |
    Well this is chockablock with completely nonsense French-isms that no French person probably ever says. 
    
    I don't hate it. It's got a fun rhythm and musicality to it. It just feels a bit forced.
    
- country: "Norway"
  shortcode: "NOR"
  emoji: "🇳🇴"
  artist: "Kyle Alessandro"
  song: "Lighter"
  language: "English"
  youtube: "pUjWzQ671MQ"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  lyric: |
    I don't need saving ’cause I’m my own lighter.
  commentary: |
    This is classic Scandi-pop, which obviously means I bloody love it.

  artist: "Justyna Steczkowska"
  song: 
    original: "Gaja"

  youtube: "YXHHDjiclxA"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  lyric: |
    The Holy Water is cleansing your fate.
  commentary: |
    This is dark and moody and, given the title of the song, I suspect intended to help you find your spiritual centre and respect Mother Earth.
    
    It’s a droning mess of noises undercut with a distorted beat. Not for me.
    
- country: "Portugal"
  shortcode: "POR"

  song: 
    original: "Deslocado"

  youtube: "-s1Cc2uEj3U"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  lyric: |
    No matter how it may seem I’ll never belong to that city.
  commentary: |
    Piano, acoustic and electric guitar, and a lilting vocal come together for this *Beatles*-adjacent, gentle track.
    
    It’s pleasing enough but it also feels unresolved. It ultimately goes nowhere.

  youtube: "Le3WpaLYRvE"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  lyric: |
    Then tomorrow we’ll regret saying “I love you”.
  commentary: |
    This sounds like it was ripped straight out of an early 2000s Eurovision Song Contest. 
    
    Yes, dear reader, it's that bad.
    
    Obviously I know that San Marino is landlocked inside Italy and that they will share a cultural affinity; but I am baffled as to why you would sing a song about *Tutta l'Italia* when, you know, you're not representing Italy?!

  youtube: "18BCbtvDcag"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  lyric: |
    Darling, you have paid the price for my love.
  commentary: |
    One of the dreariest ballads you could possibly imagine. There’s a late-game rock guitar and choral drop that does nothing to improve the overall miserable impression.

  artist: "Klemen"
  song: "How Much Time Do We Have Left"
  language: "English"
  youtube: "GT1YhfRpq3Q"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  lyric: |
    You never gave up until you grew wings.
  commentary: |
    Oh my word is this sad. You can feel the pain in this song right from the very first line.
    
    Maybe I'm feeling emotionally fragile but I genuinely had a tear in my eye.
    
    A beautiful ballad.

  youtube: "BvVxhbCW9rw"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  lyric: |
    A diva doesn't step on anyone else to shine.
  commentary: |
    This feels like a sexed-up, modernised flamenco. 
    
    A lot of distorted synths, maracas and a flamenco guitar underpin a defiant, almost vengeful, vocal.
    
- country: "Sweden"
  shortcode: "SWE"

  song:

  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  lyric: |
    Sauna brothers, we’re the ones who glow. 100 degrees, oh yes.
  commentary: |
    Eh... *what*?! What happened?!
    
    Slick Swedish pop is why I fell in love with Eurovision. This isn’t that. It’s a cheesy 1990s era comedy track.
    
    Don’t get me wrong, it has its charm, and I have no doubt there’s a gimmick that will catch the eye of the voting public (no one wins *Melodifestivalen* and gets to represent Sweden by accident) -- but I am nonetheless baffled by this.

  semifinal: false
  final: true
  lyric: |
    If you want, I'll go with you on a journey
  commentary: |
    Soft, breathy vocals and a floating melody come together to create this perfectly pleasant song that I suspect most people will forget; it’s nothing special.
    
    The last minute attempt at injecting some life into it with a staccato, violin breakdown doesn’t really do anything to save it from what I suspect will be inevitable obscurity.

  lyric: |
    Share my heart with someone who cares.
  commentary: |
    Given the song title, I was expecting something more *[Klingon](DSCWB4GqcFE?si=hpU0pWagG61tkU2A)*. 
    
    Instead we get this electric guitar-laden, soft-rock number, filled with chorus chants and false stops. All very late 90s, which is probably where it should have stayed.

  commentary: |
    This song is a disjointed mess. The tempo shifts are jarring.
    
    For a group that is allegedly a country group, there’s nothing country about it. 
    
    It seems the vocals will be strong but the song is just awful. Musical theatre-style nonsense.
    
    Just a few years ago, it felt like the UK has found its groove again. *Space Man* was a heavenly Brit-pop track that deserved the pedestal upon which we all placed it. 
    
    But this?! Not this. Anything but this.


summing-up: |
   It seems that clubland trance is the predominant order of business for Eurovision this year. What that says about the psyche of Europe is anyone's guess.
   
   My personal favourite this year is **Denmark**, with its catchy riff and slick Europop vibe. I also enjoyed **Luxembourg**, **Norway**, **Spain** and -- surprisingly a ballad -- **Slovenia**. Wooden spoons for the **United Kingdom**, **Australia** and **Estonia**.
   
   But who will win? You decide!

Well, *Mamma Mia*, here we go again. Eurovision is back and this year's battleground is the classically neutral territory of Switzerland.

This year 37 entries will be serving up 1 hour and 50 minutes of the best and worst that Europe (and Australia) has to offer.

Each year, I subject myself to a blind taste test, listening to all the tracks to glean my first impressions.

As usual, I'm only allowed to listen to each song once. I've listened to each track in a totally random order, this time around, and then scribbled down my thoughts.

So let's not delay. As a former Executive Supervisor of the Eurovision Song Contest might say, "take it away!"
