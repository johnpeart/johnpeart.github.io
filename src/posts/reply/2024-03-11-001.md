      @johnpeart I did something similar cause I think it's fun. It's a public task list, I might make them, I might not ðŸ˜‚ so yea, they fall often in the "idea" lane. I would love to see more people doing this. Even if I don't do something, maybe someone else will. Kind of the opposite of what we were taught to do with all the copyright laws. It's freeing. Let the ideas fly free!

I like the way youâ€™ve put your backlog of blogposts and website tweaks on your [to do list](https://marisabel.nl/tasks.php).

I might steal that idea!
