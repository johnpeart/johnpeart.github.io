*InFAMOUS* was one of my favourite games on PlayStation 3. Superhuman powers with the choice to be a hero or villain, with those choices changing your gameplay mechanics? Sounds great, count me in.

When I could afford to get it and the *PlayStation 4*, that was it: I was hooked.

This is another game that I technically finished, but I never went the whole hog. So I blitzed through the whole game all over again to get that Platinum.

When I played it the first time, I was the hero. This time I went full villain. What I didn't realise is that the story changed when you do that â€“ so I'm glad I went back and tried this one out a second time.
