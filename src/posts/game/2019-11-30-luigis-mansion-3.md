The first game I ever owned on the *Nintendo GameCube* was *Luigi's Mansion* and I ***loved*** it.

It was silly. It was spooky. It was challenging to 11-or-so year old me. 

So it was with much nostalgia that I immediately ordered this, *third* instalment in the series. (I skipped the second as a I never owned a *Nintendo DS*).

I love this game too. It's just as daft and funny as I remember in my addled memory. Sure, it's not anywhere near as tough as it was when I was a tween; but the puzzles are good enough. 

And it's beautiful. Even on the diminutive *Switch* hardware, it looks slick, fresh and detailed. It looks exactly how my nostalgia would imagine it.

10/10. No notes.
