Hello. 

I'm John Peart. 

I'm originally from Devon, but grew up in North Lincolnshire and Somerset. I live in London now, having originally moved here for university.

I do “policy” in the UK Civil Service. That's a fancy way of saying that I design, develop and deliver programmes of work to meet the objectives of the incumbent government. 

I specialise in digital policy. I'm deeply fascinated by the social consequences of technology. I've also spent a long time working in equalities policy.

I currently work for the [Office for Digital Identities and Attributes](//www.gov.uk/ofdia), a part of the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. We're making it possible to trust digital verification services, so you can use them across the UK economy.
