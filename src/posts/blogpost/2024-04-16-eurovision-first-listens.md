    Go 'head and give your best shot
  commentary: |
    This is a song that refuses to stick to one style or genre.

    The first minute is mellow. Ticking clocks. Light piano chords. That kind of thing. It builds as you'd expect into a fuller chorus.

    For the second verse we take a hard, left turn and drop into kick-drums and distorted synthesisers, before returning to the more chilled vibes for the chorus.

    But *Besa*, bless her, is not done.

    Why settle for two musical styles when you can have three! In the final 30 seconds we throw away what has come before and reveal a much more interesting set of instrumentation reminiscent of an 80s throwback. I can't help but wonder if the song would have been more enjoyable if it was in that final style the whole way through.

  commentary: |
    The thing I love about Eurovision is that you get to experience other cultures through their music and performance. Were it not for Eurovision, I'd never have known that I truly love Scandipop. Or that the Polish were [really into milk churning](https://youtu.be/q8J3GAg5zaI?si=dsH1oK4XiOBkTEwA&t=87).

    And this song allows me to experience something I'd never have voluntarily listened to that I presume is distinctively Armenian.

    It’s a peppy, brassy and playful track.

    And I'm sure this appeals to someone. It does not appeal to me.

    Escape with us to the planets\
    To the Fleetwood Macs and the Janets
  commentary: |
    I am pro-Australia, and pro-Australia in Eurovision. Australia remains the best winner we never had.

    But after [that soaring performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ymFX91HwM0) that was denied its rightful winner’s slot, I have been waiting for something to make me continue to believe in the “Australia is actually part of Europe” project.

    I am sorry to report that this is not it. At least, it’s not the knock out song I have been waiting for.

    Don't misunderstand me. I like the song. It’s fun. It’s camp. It’s got a pulsating rhythm that makes you want to dance to it. It’s got a didgeridoo!

    I am all aboard whatever bizarre rocket ship is taking me “to the planets” with “the Fleetwood Macs and the Janets”.

    But this feels like a song made *for* Eurovision. That isn't Australia at its best. Australia at its best is when it brings songs that sound like they are songs designed for the charts that *just happen to be at* Eurovision. That’s what [Sound of Silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ymFX91HwM0) was. That’s not what this is.

    My obvious lack of credentials established; this does appear to be a faithful recreation of a 1990s and 2000s rave sound. Lots of overdriven synths, laser sound effects, and – most importantly – generic, nonsensical female vocals.     An ultra-high tempo three minutes.

    I propose to you, friends, that this is an excellent metaphor! Do we hold *Fahree's* hopes of winning Eurovision in our hands? Does his song have what it takes to win?

    No. No, it does not.

  commentary: |
    You know when you can hear your neighbour playing music, but you can't hear it properly because it’s travelling through a wall or the floor? When it’s all a bit muffled?  To my – admittedly pretty poor – ears, this song’s got a weird aural-aesthetic quality to it that is a bit like that.

    It’s a ballad, but with seemingly-intentionally muffled instrumentation. The singers otherwise come through loud and clear, and the lead singer has a voice that might remind you of *[Brendon Urie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendon_Urie)* of *[Panic! At the Disco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic!_at_the_Disco)* fame.

    The shadow of [last year’s runner-up entry from Finland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJHe-iZ5HSI) looms large over this lyrically nonsensical crash of a song.

    It sounds like it’s ripped straight out of a boss level from the 16-bit era. Think *Sonic the Hedgehog* on the *SEGA MegaDrive*, when he’s fighting *Dr. Robotnik*.

    In 2018, Cyprus lit Lisbon on *fuego* with a fierce song from *Eleni Foureira* that almost clinched the top spot. They've tried that formula a couple times again since; including this year.

    This is another punchy track with club-worthy, slut-dropping, chest-shuddering beats from the Cypriots.

  lyric: |
    Put myself on a pedestal \
    I will be loving me more
  commentary: |
    Rock meets pop in this song. It starts at a clip, and stays high-intensity throughout.

    It reminds me of a mashup of Avril Lavigne’s “Complicated”  and Katy Perry’s “I Kissed a Girl”.

    Aiko describes the song as a “[self-love, post-breakup anthem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestal_(Aiko_song))” – whatever the hell that means –  and I suppose that explains the literal (and presumably acted) argument that she has with a nameless man towards the end of a track. It’s quite jarring in what is otherwise a fun pop-rock track.

    The first 10 seconds of this song had me immediately hooked, and then it made me feel like I'd been bait-and-switched. There’s purpose in those first few seconds; and then it takes almost a full minute to get back to that level of energy and excitement.

    When it gets going though, it’s great. The relentless synth-pop bass line feels like a throwback to Robyn’s “[Dancing On My Own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcNo07Xp8aQ)”, and Saba’s vocals cut through it beautifully.

    This song is apparently a “love letter to European hearts” from artist *Slimane*.

    It starts in the same way as every other self-indulgent French ballad that you've ever heard. It crescendos into a vocal that has a lot of strength and emotion. And yet after three minutes, I feel... nothing.

    If this is meant to sway my heart, then I regret to inform; *je ne l’aime pas*.

    But not this year gang, because Georgia’s entry is a firecracker! It’s a fresh, bassy-pop banger with a locally influenced twist.

    The vocals are great. The beat is great. It’s great.

    “I am nothing but the average”, *Isaak* roars out at the start of this song. But I think he’s singing himself a disservice; this is better than average! At least, better than the average German entry in recent years.

    Whilst the Germans have had success at Eurovision more recently than we have here in the UK – last winning the Contest in 2010 with “*Satellite*” by *Lena* – they've had a torrid time since.

    Will this [*Tom Grennan*-like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsdkvYdSzlg) track restore their fortunes? I've no clue, but I know I quite like it.

  commentary: |
    Ireland is dangerously close to losing its crown of “most Eurovision wins ever”. Last year’s win from Sweden means they now share that accolade – as well as being the only country to produce a two-time winner.

    You’d hope, on that basis, that Ireland would bring its A-game. You'd think they'd want to show up ready to win.

    And then they send an artist called *Bambie Thug* and a track called “*Doomsday Blue*” that is, to be blunt, an assault on the senses.

    Chaotic and contorted from the very first moment, this is a unique entry – of that I have no doubt – but it is also deeply, deeply unpleasant.

    I won't comment further on that; I am only interested in the music, and the music is... fine?

    It’s a ballad. It’s a fine ballad. It’s not a bad or uninteresting song by any stretch, but it doesn't pull on the heartstrings in the way the preceding controversy suggests it should.

  commentary: |
    For a song called “*Boredom*”, this is hardly boring. Maybe you should expect that from an artist with an exotic fruit in their name (*are mangos even native to Italy?!*).

    This will hit you like a steam train. Relentless, droning beats underpin a tongue-twisting lyrical tango dancing about on top of this complex track.

    It has no discernible hook or riff that’s meant to stick with you; almost as if the whole song is intended as one long verse. And I suspect that may be its undoing.

    *[Måneskin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVH5dn1cxAQ)* aside, it’s a nice change from the somewhat typical Italian formulae of recent memory of middle-aged men shouting dreary ballads down a microphone.

    The moment we've been waiting for: Luxembourg’s return to the Eurovision Song Contest after more than 30 years. Their last entry being in 1993.

    And they've brought us a song that could have been ripped out of an early 1990s Eurovision, but with a modern-francophone twist.

    It’s got up-tempo plucky guitar, tongue-twisting lyrics that flick between English and French, and a funky beat.

    There’s only one, half-arsed, fleeting moment of robustness in this entire dreary ballad. Boring. Next.

    I believe the technical term to apply to this song is “[Wall of Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_of_Sound)”. There is a *lot* going on in this frenetic, heavy rock track.

    It'll be a bold wake-up call if – as is likely – it’s surrounded by some lacklustre ballads.

    At risk of turning into a meme; *[not another one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6-IQAdFU3w)*.

    As ballads go this year, I don't think this is the worst one, but it’s not far off. This one is almost like a funeral dirge at the start, and it drags on for so long it could be used as a cure for insomnia.

    This “dark alternative pop song” is certainly dark, certainly alternative and definitely has pop!

    It has a slow wind up, but once it hits its stride there’s a fighting vocal and pulsating soundtrack to accompany it.

    Let’s go back to the 80s, kids! This is cheesy as hell, reminiscent of the [ill-fated Danish entry from 2021, *Øve os på hinanden*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2ytONrRyww) and I love it.

    Whilst the instrumentation has all the sparkle and shoulder-pads of an 80s classic, I'm disappointed by the vocal, which is comparatively underwhelming.

    It’s another highly-polished and poptastic entry from the Swedes. But what more did you expect from a country that is the undeniable powerhouse of Eurovision?

    It pales in comparison to some of Sweden’s greatest former entries, but you don't have to be outstanding to win, you just have to be better than the competition.

    It’s certainly unique, with tinges of Daft Punk and Swedish House Mafia underpinning it, and stands out amongst a crowd of mediocrity this year.

    What to make of this. It’s got flashes of theatre productions like *Phantom of the Opera* and *Hamilton*. It’s got dance beats. It’s got falsetto abound.

    So its pop, meets hip-hop, meets musicals, meets opera. Do you follow?

    I'm not really sure what to make of it.

    The choral backing vocals might give you a small clue that the “*Teresa & Maria*” referred to in this song’s title are apparently a reference to *Mother Teresa* and *the Virgin Mary*.

    It’s an interesting song, with some floaty vocals, foot-tapping beats, and lots of layers.

    Every year I cheat at this blind-taste test of Eurovision: I always listen to the UK entry as soon as I hear it’s been announced. This year was no different.

    This year’s entry is from the front man of pretty-big-deal group *Years and Years*. Now performing in the singular, *Olly Alexander* brings us *Dizzy*.

    Clearly inspired by [*It’s a Sin* by the *Pet Shop Boys*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRHetRTOD1Q) – [a song *Olly* has already covered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT1FF6ug-bw) – it borrows the same synth chord progression right from the jump.

    Out of context, it is a good song with a strong ear-worm in the chorus. In context of the other songs in this year’s Contest; dare I say it?

    I think he’s a contender.

summing-up: |
    I'll level with you. This year is not a great year for Eurovision. There isn't any one song – none – that I can point to this year and say “bloody love that one”, or even “that is obviously a winner”.

    I think in a sea of mediocrity, it’s anyone’s game to win.

It’s Eurovision time once more and Europe, it seems, is stuck on Sweden *[like a tattoo-oo-oo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE2Fj0W4jP4)*, as we return to Sweden for this year’s contest. It’s lucky number seven for the Swedes as hosts of Europe’s biggest annual music festival, and the third for the city of Malmö.

I've been blogging my first impressions of that year’s contest for a decade, based on one, back-to-back play through of the [official Eurovision Song Contest album](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/eurovision-song-contest-malm%C3%B6-2024/1736817783).

Well, here I am again. Round 10.

Not because I'm a self-appointed expert on the subject, or because I'm expecting plaudits from Eurovision influencer circles. No, I do this because it’s fun, and because I need hobbies other than drinking wine and eating cheese. I'm just telling you what I like and what I don't.

## The process

No pointless excursion through the chaos of European (and sometimes Australian) music would be complete without arbitrary rules to follow.

This year, my process has been to listen to each song once – and only once – in the order they appear on the album. After each song, I can put finger to keyboard and jot down my first impressions.

## You're good to go

Down below you'll find every entry from this year’s contest in alphabetical order by country. Thanks to a bit of Wikipedia searching, all the entries are presented using their English translated song titles.

You can filter the entries by which of the three events – semi-final one, semi-final two or the grand final – they'll be performing.

This year, the European Broadcasting Union has changed the rules of the contest too; the Big 5 (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) and last year’s winner (Sweden) will perform live during the semi-finals. Whilst you won't be able to vote for them – they still automatically qualify for the final – I've included them in their respective semi-final events too.

So, in the words of Executive Supervisor of the Eurovision Song Contest, Martin Österdahl, “you're good to go”...
