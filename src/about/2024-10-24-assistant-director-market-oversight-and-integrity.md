As the Assistant Director for Market Oversight and Integrity in the Office for Digital Identities and Attributes, I lead policy and delivery that supports the development of the digital identity market in the UK. 

My teams build and maintain the infrastructure that creates trust in digital identity and attribute services.

I am responsible for:

1. Strategic governance; leading a team that monitors the developing market and provides insight across the wider digital identity programme to continuously improve what we are doing to support the market.
2. Digital delivery; I am the service owner for a new GOV.UK register of trusted digital identity and attribute services, currently in private beta.
3. Certification; developing and maintaining the UKAS-recognised certification scheme that underpins the market. 
4. Security, fraud and threat intelligence; drawing in insight from industry and across government to keep the ecosystem and the public safe from threats as the market develops.

I directly manage around half a dozen staff, and have operational responsibility for a multi-million pound annual budget.
