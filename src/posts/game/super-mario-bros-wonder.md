*Nintendo's* game designers are masters of surprise and delight. *Super Mario Bros. Wonder* has *so, so* much of that.

Every level has a new bonkers idea, revealed by collecting a *Wonder Flower*. You may as well call them "smile machines" because when you pick one up for the first time, and are presented with the newest whacky idea, you can help but grin like the Cheshire Cat.

And like all the best Mario games, it is easy to pick up and ‌tough to perfect. There are several really challenging levels that test your platforming skills. But I prevailed. All the medals, all the *Wonder Flowers* 💯

I loved every minute.
