[@Jonathan](https://heyjonathan.micro.blog/) Yes, it did trigger a webmention! It shows up on [the original](/2023/10/31/making-webmentions-look-more-conversational/) post as expected.

It didn't trigger it properly though üôÅ

The post content has come through, but it's missing the 'author' so it shows up as an anonymous message. (I've tracked you down via the [webmention.io](https://www.webmention.io) backend.)

In case it helps, I used the [IndieWebify.Me](https://indiewebify.me) service to check that my post mark-up was working. [This is what it shows for your post](https://indiewebify.me/validate-h-entry/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fheyjonathan.micro.blog%2F2023%2F11%2F04%2Fwill-this-trigger.html); you're missing a bit of mark-up.
