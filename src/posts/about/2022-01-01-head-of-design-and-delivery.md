In this role I worked across a multi-departmental team leading the digital product management, creative production and operational delivery of the UK Government's first ever international LGBT+ rights conference, *Safe To Be Me*.

The conference was unfortunately cancelled in April 2022, leading me to look for new opportunities. Before it's cancellation, *Safe To Be Me* was intended bring together governments, business and civil society leaders from across the world to advance the fundamental rights and freedoms of LGBT+ people globally.
