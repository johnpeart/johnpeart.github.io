      I don’t have a problem with being reminded of the rules - but I do have a problem with almost all of these training modules, and it’s this: they tend to treat grown adults like children

At this rate, I’m going to have to get an “I agree with Giles” t-shirt.

Corporate “e-learning” doesn’t respect people’s intellect or, perhaps worse, their time.

They’re not even that information dense. Most of the content could fit on a single side of A4. 

Come to think of it; I suspect most people would be happy to read a stack of 1 page policies and then sit the stupid tests.
