As part of my [goals for 2024](/goals/2024), I’ve set myself an objective to read a book a month.

This is a running list of books I’m reading, or plan to. I’ll add new books, and mark off books I’ve finished, as I go!

These are not necessarily brand new books. Some of the books I plan to get around to are books that I’ve started, and then for one reason or another, not found time to finish. Books that have sat on my shelf.
