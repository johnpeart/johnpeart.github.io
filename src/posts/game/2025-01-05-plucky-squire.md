The Plucky Squire is a game of enormous charm, but also enormous bugs and hand-holding. 

It is one of the games I enjoyed playing the most over the past year. The puzzles are fun, if a bit simple. The art style is delightful. The narration and story-telling have child-like glee without being too childish for an adult to get stuck into.

Could it have gone further, and leaned into its game mechanics more? Yes.

Could it have been more polished? Certainly.

Did that get in the way of me enjoying it most of the time? No, not really. It just made me smile.
