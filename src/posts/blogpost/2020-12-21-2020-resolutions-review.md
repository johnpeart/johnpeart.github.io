For the past three years, I've been trying to get better at setting goals for myself and sticking to them.

When I tried this the first time [it didn't work out so well](/2018/12/16/ive-failed-my-2018-goals). Last year things [worked out only a little better](/2019/12/26/2019-resolutions-review). 2020 though, this was going to be the year I achieved my goals!

On New Year’s Eve 2019, [I set myself 7 goals for 2020](/2019/12/31/setting-goals-for-2020):

1. give something back as a trustee or governor
2. be a better friend by seeing them more
3. write a blog post each month
4. publish 5 episodes of a podcast
5. lose 10kg of weight
6. do dry January
7. save £5,000 by the end of the year

I followed the same structure as the past few years. These goals were bitesized, measurable and [published on the open internet](//www.johnpe.art/goals) so that I kept myself honest. They were deliberately over-stretching because I didn't expect to achieve all of them; but the goal was to achieve 80% of what I set out to do overall.

## How did I do?

Despite everything that’s happened in the hellscape that is the year 2020, things have gone remarkably well. As at 21 December 2020, **83% of my goals have have been completed** giving each goal an equal weighting.

Here’s a blow-by-blow account of progress on each goal.

### Give something back

Let’s start with the bad news: this year, I aimed to give something back by becoming a charity trustee or a college governor. I started to look but nothing suitable has come up. **So I haven't achieved this goal**.

One thing I _have_ started to do is volunteer with an LGBT+ charity, [Just Like Us](http://justlikeus.org), as a mentor. That’s a great first step, but I want to do more because I think it’s important.

I'm going to keep this goal for next year and try again.


### Be a better friend

~~I'm a bit of a loner~~ *I enjoy my own company* which means I can be a bit of a rubbish friend. This year I tried to be a better one.

The success criteria for this was to meet up with at least 12 friends; one a month. Given the whole coronavirus situation, 'meet up' obviously became 'have a video call with' a lot of people; and given everyone wanted to have those in *Lockdown #1*, I caught up with many more than 12 friends.

This goal became too easy, so I made it harder: I had to be sociable once a month, whether that was a Zoom quiz or an actual, real life interaction.

Thanks to an abundance of other friends who were also desperate for something resembling normality, **I have achieved 100% of this goal**.

### Keep writing

I like writing, so I try to keep writing. The definition of success for this goal was to write 12 blog posts this year; matching my writing pace from last year.

After a writing spurt at the start of the year, I lost steam on this goal. Nonetheless, including this post, I've written 10 blog posts in 2020, and I've one more to go[^finalpost]. That means **91% of this goal will be completed** and I can count it as 'done'.

[^finalpost]: That blog post will set out my goals for 2021.

### Start a podcast

In 2019, I had an idea for a podcast called [the Department of Bad Ideas](/2019/01/27/department-of-bad-ideas). I didn't actually get around to making it though, despite putting all the infrastructure in place. So this year, I said I'd finish it but *I haven't*. I recorded two episodes of the podcast, but I want to do a couple more before I publish them.

Despite that, **I have still achieved 100% of this goal**[^pod]. The success criteria for this goal was to publish 5 episodes of a podcast, and *I did do that*. I created a podcast for the [Civil Service LGBT+ Network](http://civilservice.lgbt) as part of its digital pride season. It’s called the PrideON podcast, and [you can listen to it on the Network’s website](http://civilservice.lgbt/podcast).

[^pod]: If you include the recorded episodes I haven't released, then I've achieved 110% of the goal.

### Be healthier

You know when people say they're going on a diet in January and then it lasts about 5 minutes before they get back on the chocolate and booze? That used to be me; but not this year.

The success criteria for this goal was to lose 10kg of weight, starting out at 80kg on 1 January 2020. As I write this I weigh exactly 70kg. **So I have achieved 100% of this goal** but, more importantly, I think I have a much healthier relationship with food than I did at the start of the year.

### Dry January

This was a pretty straightforward goal. The success criteria was to not drink alcohol for 31 days during January 2020. **I achieved 96% of this goal** and I can count it as 'done'.

### Save some money

For the third year in a row, I started the year aiming to save some money for a house deposit. For the last two years I have failed to achieve it. This year I met the goal and blew past it.

The success criteria for this goal was to save £5,000. I saved more than £9,500 this year, **achieving more than 190% of my goal**.

I suspect the pandemic, home-working and lack of going out has contributed substantially to this; but I'll take it!

### One more thing

As I approached the mid-way point of the year, I decided I needed one more thing to stretch myself. So I resurrected a goal from last year: learning to ride a bike. I never learnt as a child, so now was my chance.

In August, when the weather was good and the roads were quieter than ever, I bought a bike and I learnt to ride it. I subsequently ended up almost crashing into an oncoming vehicle and injuring my foot to the point that I haven't ridden it since, _but that is beside the point_. I can ride a bike now, even if not very confidently. **Let’s say I achieved 60% of this goal**.

## Not too shabby

It turns out a global pandemic and a year with a lot of unexpected spare time on my hands is a good environment for getting things done.

It’s nearly a new year, and substantial challenges await; not least the challenges I'm going to set myself for 2021. Next year, I'll have to think about how I stay this on top of my goals as we get back to normal (_fingers crossed_).
