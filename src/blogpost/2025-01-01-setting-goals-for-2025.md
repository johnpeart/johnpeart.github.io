Rather than “resolutions”, I have an annual tradition of setting myself several specific, measurable goals that I can form new habits around across the year.

I set multiple separate targets so that if one of them goes off the rails, I can still succeed at something else and not get too down beat about it. I track all the goals online so that anyone that knows me can nudge me to get back on track.

I already have a sense that 2025 is going to be the most demanding year yet, between work and an ongoing, all-consuming dispute with our freeholder and management company that is probably going to end up in court. I also have an idea for an enormous project that I want to be the main focus of my spare time already; and that project doesn't lend itself to this kind of goal tracking.

Accordingly, I am dialling back my ambitions a little bit and setting myself some goals that I'm confident I can manage on top of what will certainly be a hectic work-life balance. 

## My goals for 2025

### 1. Weeknote

[Giles](//gilest.org) has given me the bug for [doing weeknotes](//doingweeknotes.com). Last year, in spurts, I started to weeknote and this year I'm going to have a real crack at doing it every week.

> **Success measure:** Publish a weeknote every week

### 2. Share

Last year, I started to share a variety of new types of blog post on my website; [notes](/notes), [lists](/lists), [music](/music), [games](/games), [replies](/replies), [reposts](reposts), [weeknotes](/weeknotes), and [‘now’ posts](/now). That enabled me to be a bit less uptight about maintaining a perfect walled-garden and instead to re-wild my online presence.

This year, I'm going to continue to POSSE[^posse], aiming to publish at least one thing on my website every week in the same way I would have done on centralised social media siloes.

[^posse]: That's an IndieWeb term that stands for “[Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere](https://indieweb.org/POSSE)”.

> **Success measure:** Share something on my website once a week

### 3. Exercise

This year I am changing my fitness goal to be a bit tougher.

Instead of closing my “Activity Rings” in general terms, I am only going to count intentional, serious exercise towards my goals this year. I want to go for a run, hit the gym, do some weights, go bouldering or some other kind of more intensive workout at least 4 times a week.

> **Success measure:** Exercise for at least 30 minutes an average of 4 times a week (and going for a walk doesn't count)

### 4. Save

I've been trying to put money aside for a rainy day ever since I started to track these goals. 

Now that I have a mortgage rather than renting, and enough put aside for a rainy day in my bank account already, it actually makes very little sense to put money into a savings account. Even with interest rates on savings accounts much higher than my mortgage rate (I was lucky and locked in a 2% rate before the rates hikes started), I'm still earning a pittence on savings and paying a tonne in mortgage interest. So, I am going to switch gears. 

Instead of putting cash into a saving's account, I'm going to treat my mortgage as a savings account. I'm going plow every spare penny I have this year directly into my mortgage instead.

> **Success measure**: Overpay on my mortgage by at least £5,000

## Off we go! 

So those are my *slightly* less ambitious goals for the year ahead. Onwards!
