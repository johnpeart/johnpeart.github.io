This month marks the anniversary of [the Stonewall uprising](https://www.johnpe.art/note/1751112000/); or as you might more commonly hear it referred to, “Pride Month”.[^1]

Several years ago, I was asked at the last minute to present to around 100 civil servants about pride... in no more than 5 minutes.

No one likes listening to these kinds of presentations – including me. They invariably turn into a tedious history lesson. A well-meaning but ultimately ineffective use of 5 minutes.

So instead, I chose a different message. 

This is what I said to them[^2].

[^1]: I personally hate the term "Pride Month". Pride events happen all year round, all over the globe. And whilst the Stonewall uprising was significant, it isn't the *only* important moment for the advancement of LGBT rights. Nonetheless, folk think June is the month of pride, and I am not going to fix their misconception by screaming into the void!

[^2]: I have recreated the slides I used, and slightly amended the speaking notes for clarity.

> This summer, many of us will be celebrating LGBT+ pride.
> 
> I'm going to give you a quick explanation of what that is, why I think it still matters and what that means for **you**, even if you're not LGBT+.

![Text: What is it?](/images/presentation/allying-is-a-verb-not-a-noun/slide2.jpg){.rounded .slide .popout}

> So, what is pride?

> To understand that, you need to know that back in 1969, in New York City, police tried to raid an LGBT+ bar called the Stonewall Inn. 
> 
> The patrons of that bar decided that "enough was enough". The events that followed kicked off what we know as pride today.

> Now, pride is an annual celebration of LGBT+ people.
> 
> It's a chance to remember how far we've come in creating a diverse and inclusive society where people are safe and free to be themselves. 
> 
> It's a celebration, but it's also a protest and a reminder of how far we still have to go on that journey.

![Text: Why is it important?](/images/presentation/allying-is-a-verb-not-a-noun/slide5.jpg){.rounded .slide .popout}

> So it's been going on for more than half a century. Why should we still care about it now?
> 
> I'm going to show you some data from a government survey – the National LGBT Survey – conducted in 2018, and some Civil Service People Survey results from 2019.

![Text: More than two-thirds of respondents to the National LGBT Survey said they would avoid holding hands with a same-sex partner in public for fear of a negative reaction.](/images/presentation/allying-is-a-verb-not-a-noun/slide6.jpg){.rounded .slide .popout}

> Of the 108,000 LGBT+ people that responded to the [National LGBT survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-lgbt-survey-summary-report) – at the time, the largest survey of its kind ever conducted – two-thirds of respondents said that they avoided holding hands with their same-sex partner in public because they feared the negative repercussions.

![Text: 67% of trans respondents to the National LGBT Survey said they avoid being open about their gender identity for fear of a negative reaction.](/images/presentation/allying-is-a-verb-not-a-noun/slide7.jpg){.rounded .slide .popout}

> In that same survey, of the respondents who identified as trans, 67% of them said they avoided sharing with other people that they are trans – again, because they feared the negative reaction.

![Text: These experiences extend to the workplace too...](/images/presentation/allying-is-a-verb-not-a-noun/slide8.jpg){.rounded .slide .popout}

> So pride still matters because people don't feel safe to be themselves in public.
> 
> And those feelings and experiences extend into the workplace too...

![Text: LGBT+ civil servants responding to the Civil Service People Survey said they experience bullying, harassment and discrimination twice as often as cisgender and straight staff](/images/presentation/allying-is-a-verb-not-a-noun/slide9.jpg){.rounded .slide .popout}

> In the [2019 Civil Service People Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-people-survey-2019-results), when you break down the responses by peoples' sexual orientation and whether or not they are transgender, you find that almost twice as many LGBT+ staff say they'd experienced bullying, harassment and discrimination as those who were not LGBT+.[^3]
> 
> Transgender staff, in particular, experience some of the highest rates of bullying, harassment and discrimination of any group in the Civil Service.

[^3]: Whilst these figures come from the 2019 Civil Service people survey, the general trend has been the same for a long time and still is today. LGBT+ people in the Civil Service consistently report higher levels of bullying, harassment and discrimination than other staff do.

![Text: So what?](/images/presentation/allying-is-a-verb-not-a-noun/slide10.jpg){.rounded .slide .popout}

> So that's what pride is and a few examples of why it still matters, but so what? 
> 
> Why should you care about it? Especially if you're not LGBT+?

![Text: I come with a challenge...](/images/presentation/allying-is-a-verb-not-a-noun/slide11.jpg){.rounded .slide .popout}

> Well, whilst many LGBT+ people will celebrate pride this year, I come with a challenge for the more than 90% of people here today that are not LGBT+.
> 
> This challenge doesn't relate to pride and LGBT+ inclusion; it's a universal message that applies to us all, in many different contexts.

![Text: “I am an ally”](/images/presentation/allying-is-a-verb-not-a-noun/slide12.jpg){.rounded .slide .popout}

> These words are a common phrase used across our workplaces in recent years.
> 
> "I am an ally".
> 
> Maybe you've seen someone with the message in their email signature or wearing a rainbow lanyard.
> 
> Maybe you have said these words out loud. Or you think you could say them.
> 
> So the start of my challenge is this:

![A large red cross covering some text. Text: “I am an ally”](/images/presentation/allying-is-a-verb-not-a-noun/slide13.jpg){.rounded .slide .popout}

> If you are the person who usually says "I am an ally", I challenge you to stop doing that.
> 
> Don't be an ally.
> 
> Or, more specifically, don't *call* yourself an ally.

![Text: It's a verb, not a noun](/images/presentation/allying-is-a-verb-not-a-noun/slide14.jpg){.rounded .slide .popout}

> My challenge to you is to think about it as a verb, and not as a noun.
> 
> Don't call yourself an ally and think it's "job done" on including your LGBT+ colleagues, or even your LGBT+ family and friends.
> 
> It's not a badge of honour. It's a call to action. 
> 
> It's a promise to act.

![Text: Don't be an ally. Do allying.](/images/presentation/allying-is-a-verb-not-a-noun/slide15.jpg){.rounded .slide .popout}

> Don't be an ally. Do allying.
> 
> You have to *do* something to make a meaningful difference to the stats that I shared earlier on.

![A list of activities you can do to “do allying” (see speaker notes below)](/images/presentation/allying-is-a-verb-not-a-noun/slide16.jpg){.rounded .slide .popout}

> And there are loads of things you could do. Big and small.
> 
> Fill in your diversity data on your HR system.
> 
> Do some research and learn about the experiences that LGBT+ people face in their day-to-day lives.
> 
> Just have a chat with an LGBT+ person about pride – maybe someone in your team.
> 
> Volunteering. Go and volunteer with an LGBT+ charity[^4]. If you can't donate your time, maybe you can afford to donate some cash[^5].
> 
> Talk to your family about it. Maybe you have kids you can talk to about LGBT+ identities, and how you accept and celebrate them.
> 
> Check people's pronouns. Use and respect them.
> 
> Help out your workplace LGBT+ network.
> 
> Or, if you're living nearby one, go to a pride event. Watch and show your support at the marches that take place.
> 
> The list is almost endless!

> So that's what pride is, why it still matters, and a challenge to you to ally yourself to LGBT+ people.

> Happy pride. Go and do allying!
