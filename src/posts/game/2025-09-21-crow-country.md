I've never gelled with the survival-horror genre. Games like *Resident Evil* have always seemed too clunky to me. The tanky and janky mechanics always put me off.

But *Crow Country* has made me realise that I've been overlooking something. They are just not-very-scary puzzle games. Or at least, the original, PS1 era games are. The kind of “let me get a pen and paper” puzzle game that I didn't know I was missing!

*Crow Country* is oozes 90s nostalgia in a compelling way. I bloody loved it.

This is not a hard game at all. The whole game takes only a few hours to complete. Less so if you're speed running it.  I've blitzed through it twice to grab the PlayStation Platinum trophy now. The first run with an *A+* ranking – owing to using more than 50 healing items (oops!) – and an *S+* ranking on the second run through where I speed-ran everything with *no healing items whatsoever!* (Yes, I'm chuffed with that one.)

It's not hard, but it is a lot of fun. I'd recommend if you're looking for a spooky game as we approach Halloween.
