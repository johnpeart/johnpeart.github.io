*Astro's Playroom* is the pack-in title for the PlayStation 5. It's not usually a game I would even think twice about playing; I played Astro's VR outing on the original PSVR and was thoroughly underwhelmed by it. But I was persuaded that this was worth my time, and boy was it!

You whip around four PlayStation 5 hardware-themed worlds – Memory Meadow, Cooling Springs, SSD Speedway, and GPU Jungle – collecting coins and puzzle pieces. Not an especially groundbreaking formula but it's a game so clearly made with enormous amounts of love for everything PlayStation you can't help but beam all the way through it.
