When people go to other countries, they often like to eat “traditional” foods.

Fish and chips in Britain. Pizza in Italy. Snails in France. You get the idea.

Many years ago now, when I visited Vienna for the first time, I was desperate to locate what I saw as the pinnacle of biscuits – *the Viennese whirl*. A delightful biscuit sandwich, filled with cream and jam.

Except I could not do that.

Viennese whirls, it turns out, are not from Vienna. They are in fact a British invention. What Vienna is known for is apparently pastries. *Danish* pastries, to be specific.

Yes, that's right, *the Danish* is not from Copenhagen, its from Vienna.

In seconds my world view was shattered. This nonsensical, geographically negligent nomenclature had me furious. 

So now I'm keeping this list of things named after places that have no connection to those places.
