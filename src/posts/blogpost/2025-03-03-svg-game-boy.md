Last year, I added a new *collection* to my blog filled with [games I've been playing](/games). Some of those games have been *Game Boy* games.

To bring the collection to life, I created isometric-perspective illustrations of *Game Paks*; the cartridges for the *Game Boy* system.

It’s fun to see these cartridges atop my short form blogging, because video games are a visual medium. Words are not always enough. 

Sometimes I have found myself also wanting to show the actual game, through screenshots.

## *Itty bitty* screen space

The *Game Boy* screen was a resolution of 144 pixels high by 160 pixels wide; 23,040 pixels in total. That is *tiny* by modern standards. 

By comparison: the screen on your phone – despite being roughly 3 times physically larger than the *Game Boy's* screen – probably has north of 3 *million* pixels. 

As natively *Game Boy* screenshots are incredibly low resolution, sharing them in a blog post can end in some ugly results. You either end up with an image so physically small it’s comical, or with an oversized image that is fuzzy and pixelated.

## Screenshots belong on *screens*


I've given my *Game Boy* screenshots a Game Boy-like console to feel at home in.

{% include 'components/objects/pocket.svg' screenshot:'/images/games/wario-land/' screenshotCount:'001' %}

Modelled on the *[Analogue Pocket](//analogue.co/pocket)*, this console-like frame is a resolution-independent SVG. The screenshots are inserted dynamically into the frame, with a gridded filter applied on top, to give them a more period-appropriate feeling. 

It’s got both a light and dark colour scheme, too (you can see for yourself by toggling dark mode on your device).

This is completely frivolous but I think it looks cool. Now, my *Game Boy* screenshots aren't too small or too big, and they're properly framed.
