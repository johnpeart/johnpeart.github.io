In the first few minutes of *Cocoon*, I let out an audible "woah". If you haven't played it, I won't spoil it by explaining what caused that exclamation; you should just try it yourself. That feeling of mind-bending awesomeness just kept happening all the way through this 4 to 6 hour jaunt. 

It's an incredibly simple game to pick up and get into – you only use the `X` button and the left joystick for the entire game – but the puzzles layer and layer throughout to make you feel like a freaking genius by the end of it.

This game is so good, I got the Platinum trophy *twice*![^1] And I suspect I'll play it a third time, next time I'm looking for a quick jaunt to scratch a brain itch.

[^1]: A weird quirk of the PlayStation now is that if you play a PS4 version of the game, and then also play the PS5 version, the trophies track separately. Doesn't seem like a particularly difficult problem for Sony to have resolved by now, merging them all together, but for whatever reason they haven't.
