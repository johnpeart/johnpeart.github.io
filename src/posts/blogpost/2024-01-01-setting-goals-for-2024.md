MMXXIV. The year of the Dragon. Twenty twenty-four. 

It’s a brand new year! And that means it’s time for a brand new set of personal goals for the year ahead. 

Since 2018, I've set myself some public goals at the turn of the year. Not *resolutions*; goals. 

I set multiple separate targets. I set more than one so that if I fail at one, I can still succeed at something else. Each goal must be specific and measurable. And all the goals get publicly tracked so friends, family or *anyone* can hold me accountable and keep me on task.

## My goals for 2024

### 1. Read more

I don’t really enjoy reading. I never have. Those people that enjoy sitting quietly in a corner and chewing through a thousand pages in a weekend? Not me. 

Weirdly, I buy books all the time! I flick through a couple chapters, and then they just sit on my shelves in near-pristine condition, waiting for their remaining pages to be perused. Especially fiction books; those are the worst.

I feel like I’m missing out on some great ideas though. So, this year, my goal is to try to read more. One book, of any kind, each month.

> **Success measure:** 12 books read by 31 December 2024

### 2. Share more

I might not read books often, but I do read a lot online. My slow departure from centralised social media sites like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter means I don’t share the stuff I find as often anymore.

I do blog a lot on this humble site, but that tends to be when I have “big thoughts”; not all blogging or ideas have to be *big*. 

So this year, a new goal that builds on my previous goals to blog more. Instead of writing “big” blog posts at least once a month, I’m going to aim to share *anything I want* on this site at least once a week.

It might be a fleeting thought, an album I like, a photo, an article. It might also just be a normal blogpost. Basically, anything!

I’ve been experimenting with a new [stream page](/stream) with some new post formats like [notes](/note/1701945480/), [photos](/photo/1701708419/) and [comments](/share/1703803888/) in recent weeks. Now it’s time to go wholesale!

> **Success measure:** Share something on my website 52 times by 31 December 2024

### 3. Save some money

This is a repeat entry in my goals list so very little explanation needed. Just save some money!

> **Success measure**: £5,000 saved by 31 December 2024

### 4. Close my activity rings

Finally, another repeat entry from last year. Close my activity rings on my Apple Watch every day. 

> **Success measure:** Close each activity ring 365 times.

## Go! 

4 new goals for the year ahead. The challenge starts now.
