eurovision-entries:
- country: "Sweden"
  song: "I Can't Go On"
  artist: "Robin Bengtsson"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    I love Swedish pop music and I love this track.
    If it survives this graveyard slot, I'd guess it’s a potential winner.

- country: "Georgia"
  song: "Keep The Faith"
  artist: "Tamara Gachechhiladze"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Even with a decent vocal and key change, nothing can save this uninspiring and incoherent ballad.

- country: "Australia"
  song: " Don't Come Easy"
  artist: "Isaiah"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    This is as slick as usual from Australia, but it lacks the funk of 2015 and the sparkle of 2016. It’s good, but not amazing.


- country: "Albania"
  song: "World"
  artist: "Lindita"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Despite a fairly interesting middle eight, this song is fairly drab. I don't like it. If I had to guess, you won't either.

- country: "Belgium"
  song: "City Lights"
  artist: "Blanche"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    This instrumentation is like a 9 year old that’s had too much sugar. Aside from some falsetto, its a bit anti-climactic.

- country: "Montenegro"
  song: "Space"
  artist: "Slavko Kalezić"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    This guy is *literally* singing about having wet dreams in disco space. I don't know where to start with that.

- country: "Finland"
  song: "Blackbird"
  artist: "Norma John"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Look, Finland: I don't mind if you want a ballad as your entry, I just want a good one, not a snooze fest.

- country: "Azerbaijan"
  song: "Skeletons"
  artist: "Dihaj"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    This track sounds like I imagine a UFO’s engine sounds. It’s fun. It’s spacey-wacey. I like it, but don't love it.

- country: "Portugal"
  song: "Amar Pelos Dois"
  artist: "Salvador Sobral"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Portugal are back! Unfortunately.

    The only thing that song would be good for is to help insomniacs finally get some shuteye.

- country: "Greece"
  song: "This is Love"
  artist: "Demy"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Love, this is not, for this pop ballad cum Swedish House anthem. It fails to excite for more than a fleeting moment.

- country: "Poland"
  song: "Flashlight"
  artist: "Kasia Maos"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    This is crap. But it doesn't matter: the diaspora will ensure scores well regardless, as is the way of things.

- country: "Moldova"
  song: "Hey Momma"
  artist: "Sunstroke Project"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    **Hello Momma!** This is a fun, frenetic, funk-fest. Fun but not phenomenal. It'll be good for a dance though.

- country: "Iceland"
  song: "Paper"
  artist: "Svala"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    These lyrics are unintelligible. I love a good broken metaphor, but these are more broken than crumbling *papier mache*.

- country: "Czech Republic"
  song: "My Turn"
  artist: "Martina Bárta"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    This low-budget, Michelle McManus, Pop Idol vibe is doing nothing for me. The final crescendo is totally squandered too.

- country: "Cyprus"
  song: "Gravity"
  artist: "Hovig"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Normally I've no time for the dross Cyprus enters. But this? This is almost like Cyprus have put some effort in! Bravo.

- country: "Armenia"
  song: "Fly With Me"
  artist: "Artsvik"
  semifinal: 1
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Whilst the instrumentation is trippy, there’s less vocal *punch* in this track than on an overbooked United flight. Dull.

- country: "Slovenia"
  song: "On My Way"
  artist: "Omar Naber"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    This is definitely a lost track from a Disney movie that never got finished because someone realised it was rubbish.

- country: "Latvia"
  song: "Line"
  artist: "Triana Park"
  semifinal: 1
  final: false
  commentary: |
    This high-energy track would be at home in European gay clubs, but with such over-processed vocals, it’s underwhelming.

- country: "Serbia"
  song: "In Too Deep"
  artist: "Tijana Bogicevic"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    This is unexpectedly strong from Serbia. It’s not my favourite club-style anthem this year, but it’s a solid crack.

- country: "Austria"
  song: "Running On Air"
  artist: "Nathan Trent"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    I only have one question about this song: is this an advert for Nike?

    This is fun, likeable song, but it’s no showstopper.

- country: "Russia"
  song: "Flame Is Burning"
  artist: "Julia Samoylova"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Russia have pulled out because [*politics*](https://eurovision.tv/story/russia-unable-to-participate-2017-ebu-statement). Having heard this track, I'm OK with: it’s one of their weakest entries in years.

- country: "Macedonia"
  song: "Dance Alone"
  artist: "Jana Burčheska"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Oi Macedonia! Icona Pop called: they want their song back!

    This is a floor-filler: it’s 80s synth meets 2017 club anthem.

- country: "Malta"
  song: "Breathlessly"
  artist: "Claudia Faniello"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    With this track, you never stop hoping that vocalist Claudia might really run out of air, just so the song ends sooner.

- country: "Romania"
  song: " Yodel It! (feat. Alex Florea)"
  artist: " Iliaca"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    So this song has yodelling.

    It’s novel! It’s impressive!

    *It takes about 30 seconds before it starts to piss you off!*

- country: "Netherlands"
  song: "Lights and Shadows"
  artist: "OG3NE"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Some beautiful multi-part harmonies, a brilliant middle eight crescendo, *and* (possibly false) key change. Great!

- country: "Hungary"
  song: "Origi"
  artist: "Joci Papai"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    This is a completely incoherent mess of a track. Partly as I can't speak Hungarian; mostly in the sense that it’s shit.

- country: "Denmark"
  song: "Where I Am"
  artist: "Anja Nissen"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    I freaking love this. Tub-thumping track, authoritative vocals and a bassline that gets you in the gut.


- country: "Ireland"
  song: " Dying to Try"
  artist: "Brendan Murray"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    This takes way, way too long to get going, and by the time it does, it’s too late to bring it back. Just a bit boring.

- country: "San Marino"
  song: "Spirit of the Night"
  artist: "Valentina Monetta & Jimmie Wilson"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    This song proves yet again that life’s too short to listen to San Marino’s Eurovision tracks. *presses skip track button*.

- country: "Croatia"
  song: "My Friend"
  artist: "Jacques Houdek"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Imagine Alan Menken had a gay-by with Pavarotti. Now imagine that whilst on a bad acid trip. That’s what this is like.

- country: "Norway"
  song: "Grab the Moment"
  artist: "Jowst"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Aside from the graphic lyrical imagery, this is yet another Bieber-style affair that doesn't stand out from the pack.

- country: "Switzerland"
  song: "Apollo"
  artist: "Timebelle"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    There is more precision in the execution of this powerful, beautiful song than a well made Swiss watch. Just excellent.

- country: "Belarus"
  song: "Story of My Life"
  artist: "NAVIBAND"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    What is this?! Terribly executed, folk-rock.

    If I had a life as bad as this "story" sounds, I'd be asking for a do-over.

- country: "Bulgaria"
  song: "Beautiful Mess"
  artist: "Kristian Kostov"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    It doesn't matter how much of a beautiful mess this is, it'll never be better than Poli Genova from 2016. Never.

- country: "Lithuania"
  song: "Rain of Revolution"
  artist: "Fusedmarc"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Remember the super annoying French horn from *Theme Hospital*’s sound track? That’s here in this really terrible track.

- country: "Estonia"
  song: "Verona"
  artist: "Koit Toome and Laura"
  semifinal: 2
  final: false
  commentary: |
    Estonia going choosing a Shakespearean tragedy as the theme of their song is a bold *and* a self-referential choice. Poor.

- country: "Israel"
  song: "I Feel Alive"
  artist: "Imri"
  semifinal: 2
  final: true
  commentary: |
    This starts with purpose, builds well, and adds enough twists to keep things interesting throughout. A crowd pleaser.

- country: "Germany"
  song: "Perfect Life"
  artist: "Levina"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    This appears to have sampled *Journey*; which is fine. I'm not falling asleep to it. I'm also don't have the feels.

- country: "Spain"
  song: "Do It For Your Lover"
  artist: "Manuel Navarro"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Just bring back [Ruth Lorenzo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OtuM3Zvkeo)?

- country: "France"
  song: " Requiem"
  artist: "Alma"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    I *was* thinking 'how typically dark, moody and French'. Then **WHAM**, you get drama and sparkle. Pleasantly surprised.

- country: "United Kingdom"
  song: "Never Give Up On You"
  artist: "Lucie Jones"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    They've done a number on this compared to how dull it sounded during our national selection, but that won't save it.

- country: "Italy"
  song: "Occidentali’s Karma"
  artist: "Francesco Gabbani"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Apparently this song has something to do with a gorilla? Yeah, me neither. Basically a crappy Coldplay rip-off. But I love it!

- country: "Ukraine"
  song: "Time"
  artist: "O.Torvald"
  semifinal: false
  final: true
  commentary: |
    Ah, so Ukraine realised they can't afford to host again next year then. It’s different: but that’s not a good thing.

It’s become a little tradition of mine to give first impressions of the year’s Eurovision entries on the day the official album gets released.

This year, as last, I'm doing it in strict 140 character form: tweet sized commentary on every track.

I've listened to them all in the order they will be performed, rather than the order they appear on the album; for no other reason than because I can.
